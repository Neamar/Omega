(2, 1, '2011-02-12 19:25:33', '%LS : l\\AN est “vicaire de Longinus”\n%De mon côté, je découvre le monde des \\i{propinqui} et la malédiction de la non-vie : faire partie d’un monde qui nous a vus naître mais nous évite, avançant par touches imperceptibles... sans nous. La perte de \\J me laisse isolée et seule : un ostracisme forcé commun à tous les damnés qui nous mène tout doucement vers la folie...\\\\\n%Contrairement au \\SX humain, le \\SX vampirique est une parodie de démocratie : privés des plaisirs de la vie, notre Requiem éternel nous pousse aux intrigues, aux complots et aux rivalités sans fin.\n%V a RDV avec l’\\AN en fin de nuit.\n% La voix de l’\\AN “sort des profondeurs”.\n% La robe a pris feu très vite\n\nJe m''appelle \\V.\n\nPour comprendre mon histoire, je dois malheureusement en revenir à mon enfance.\nJe ne m’y éterniserai pas car elle ne fut pas joyeuse ; mon père me battait, ma mère buvait. Caricatural ? Peut-être. Mais je n’avais pas mieux, et jusqu’à mes dix-sept ans je dus faire avec ce que le destin m’avait fourni.\nMon récit débute par une rencontre. Mais n’allez pas croire que je rencontrais l’Amour avec un grand A ; loin de là.\n\nMon père venait de me frapper. Une fois de trop. Ce fut le catalyseur ; j''attendais que la maisonnée soit tranquille pour quitter définitivement le domicile familial.\\\\\nPour être franche, je devrais ajouter que je volais aussi la bague de mon père : la seule richesse qu''il ait jamais eu, et la seule vengeance que je pouvais avoir sur lui.\n\nAlors que je vaquais sans but dans les rues romaines encombrées d''ordures, au milieu de la nuit, un homme se placa en travers de mon chemin. Au début, je crus qu''il s''agissait d''un lépreux : son visage était ravagé, sa pâleur cadavérique et ses yeux me fixaient au plus profond de moi-même. Une sensation bien trop familière -- la peur -- m''envahit et me tétanisa.  L''homme jeta un œil sur la bague que je portais au doigt. Une simple bague, avec un "V" dessus. Comme mon nom.\\\\\n"Tiens tiens... mais qui voilà donc ?". Je n''osais répondre ; pourtant je n''étais pas du genre à avoir la langue dans ma poche. Mais sur le coup, une seule pensée occupait mon esprit : fuir. Même s''il me fallait rejoindre la maison familiale, cela me paraissait préférable à quelques secondes de plus avec cet inconnu terrifiant. Sans réfléchir, mes jambes bougèrent ; mais avant que je puisse me tourner et m’échapper, l''homme m''avait saisi à la gorge. "Si ce n''est pas une petite Valens... Intéressant comme la vie vous permet de vous venger ; ces petites opportunités qu''il faut savoir saisir. Ta famille a l''air tombé bien bas, petite mortelle... Oh oui, bien bas". Ses yeux bougeaient follement, et ses lèvres se retroussèrent en un hideux sourire, dévoilant une rangée de dents anormalement sales. "Je sais ce que je vais faire... Oh oui, voilà une excellente surprise pour son réveil..."\\\\\nEn un clin d''œil, ses deux canines prirent de l''ampleur et dépassèrent de sa lèvre inférieure. Et avant même que je ne bouge ou crie, il m''avait envoyée contre un mur, s''était positionné au-dessus de moi et plantait ses dents dans mon cou. Une sensation extrêmement désagréable et douloureuse au premier abord, se transformant rapidement en vagues successives de bien-être.\n\nÀ mon réveil, l''inconnu n''était plus là... et moi, j''étais une vampire. Je me cachais instinctivement quand le soleil commençait à poindre et je ressentais une soif inextinguible que rien ne pouvait contenter. Après deux nuits d''errances, l''esprit obnubilé par ma faim, je me retrouvais devant la porte de ce qui avait été ma maison. Sans même réfléchir, je la poussais. Je me souviens de mon père qui se lève, de ma mère qui soupire. De la première remarque acerbe de mon père. Du grand sourire que je lui fais... un sourire avec des dents plus longues que celui qu''il avait pu connaître quand j''étais encore une enfant.\\\\\nJe les ai tués. Tous les deux ; découvrant ainsi comment contenter mes pulsions et me nourrir. C''était si simple... il suffisait de se laisser aller. Le pouvoir, la puissance... tout ce que je n''avais jamais osé espérer, je l''avais à ma disposition. Repue et satisfaite de moi-même, je me cachais dans la cave de la maison dont je venais d’hériter.\n\nLe soir suivant, j''errais mécaniquement dans les rues ; me demandant qui j''allais tuer. Cette grosse femme là-bas ? Cet enfant qui court ? Ce vieillard qui vit dans la rue, au milieu des ordures ? Cet homme, qui me regarde d''un air bizarre ? Oui, voilà une bonne cible. Une bête s''éveille en moi : c''est l''heure de manger. Peu m''importe ce qu''en diront les spectateurs : il me faut du sang frais ; cet homme en a assez pour me nourrir. Je le sens plus fortement que tous les autres, j''ai déjà son goût en bouche...\\\\\nJe cours... mes canines sortent... je ne contrôle plus rien, je suis un animal affamé... et puis... alors que j''allais planter mes crocs sur sa nuque immobile, l''homme me saisit avec une vitesse que je n''aurais pas crue possible, une célérité inhumaine. "Toi... il va falloir qu''on ait une petite discussion."\n\nC''est ainsi que j''ai rencontré \\T. Il est le \\L vampirique envoyé par Rome. Grâce à lui, je sais que les vampires vivent en secret avec les mortels, qu''ils ne tuent pas leurs proies, qu''ils forment une société cohérente et démocratique que l''on nomme \\CAM.\nIl m''apprit aussi que j''étais la descendante lointaine de l''ancien \\L vampirique de \\LUG, un homme puissant nommé lui aussi \\V : c’était à lui qu’appartenait ma bague. Même si je ne lui ai jamais révélé ma nuit de folie chez ceux qui avaient été mes parents, je pense qu''il a toujours su ce qu''il s''était passé... il a agi comme un Père pour moi.\n\nIl fit pression pour que je sois intégrée dans la partie dirigeante de la \\CAM, le \\SX. Il prit part à des débats, fit valoir mes droits héréditaires ; tordit probablement quelques poignets : mais après plusieurs jours de palabres, j''avais une voix à part entière au \\SX, avec les six autres que j''appris rapidement à connaître.\\\\\n\\CAE, l''\\AE de la ville : une folle imbue d''elle-même soi-disant supérieure à tous les vampires. Sans même parler des humains : elle va jusqu''à porter des gants pour éviter tout contact avec les "inférieurs". Elle me hait, et je le lui rends bien : mon ascension rapide l’insupporte, ses remarques guindées me sont intolérables.\\\\\n\\G, le vampire-enfant magistrat de la \\LM, chargé d''assurer la sécurité et d''exécuter les ordres du \\SX. Un fanatique refusant toute évolution de la \\CAM et assassinant sans poser de questions quand le \\SX lui en donne l''ordre. \\\\\n\\A, le barbare gaulois. Une brute épaisse sans subtilité ni intelligence, mais qui semble se souvenir de ses origines humaines quand cela compte vraiment.\\\\\n\\CAY, la prêtresse du culte de Cybèle. Une illuminée à la tête de sa propre religion, une haruspice interprétant dans son propre intérêt l''agencement des entrailles.\\\\\n\\J, le \\Q aux yeux crevés. Un dangereux psychopathe n''ouvrant la bouche que pour déverser son fiel ou faire brûler des chrétiens.\\\\\n\\T, \\L et premier contact dans la société vampirique. Un dépravé soi-disant hédoniste, aboutissement de centaines d''années de décadence romaine dans des orgies immondes. Si au début il paraissait agréable, la vie à son contact m’avait appris à exécrer son mode de vie et à ne plus le conserver que comme un allié politique.\\\\\nEt moi bien sûr, seule personne équilibrée de cette histoire.\n\nTous disaient être vieux, -- et mon instinct me le confirmait -- mais ils avaient gardés un corps souple qui ne reflétait en rien leur âge réel. Seule, mon visage d''enfant se flétrissait ; mes yeux devenaient fous, mes cheveux raides et rêches. \\T m''informa que la faute en revenait au vampire qui m''avait étreint, mais je savais qu''il s''agissait d''une malédiction divine, punition pour le meurtre de mes géniteurs.\n\nDans ma vie, j''allais quelquefois à l''église. C''était un lieu secret, car la religion catholique naissante était assez peu appréciée par le canon officiel romain. À l''époque, je n''y avais jamais vraiment cru et y allais surtout pour m’éviter des coups de mon père, mais la situation avait changé... et je me tournais vers Dieu, dans l''espoir qu''Il puisse m''aider et m’absoudre de mes crimes originels. Je n’étais plus qu’une damnée, et je partageais avec Longinus le soldat et les autres vampires une malédiction divine. Je découvris que je n''étais pas la seule vampire à pratiquer ce culte interdit : une organisation secrète vampirique, qui se nommait \\LS, professait que les vampires étaient des pécheurs maudits qui devaient se repentir pour rejoindre -- métaphoriquement parlant -- le soleil. J''adhérais à leurs idées de rédemption, tout en sachant qu''elles étaient hautement polémiques. J''en eus la confirmation quand, lors d''une réunion du \\SX, un membre de la \\LS fut présenté devant nous. Au simple chef d''accusation "chrétien", des huées retentirent dans la salle -- les débats sont publics, mais seuls nous sept pouvons voter. Je ne pouvais le défendre publiquement sans m’impliquer : mon esprit se battait pour savoir quel camp choisir. Avant que je n’ai le temps de trouver un consensus avec moi-même, le débat était déjà passé : il fallait voter. Comme un seul homme, mes six voisins se levèrent au mot “coupable” : je ne pouvais lutter, et préférais abdiquer, me levant avec honte pour les rejoindre au rang des bourreaux.\\\\\nL''homme était condamné à la peine capitale ; on l''attacha dans la cour d''une villa, on demanda à des goules\\footnote{Le lecteur ignorant des traditions vampiriques sera heureux d''apprendre qu''une goule n''est aucunement un monstre. Il s''agit simplement d''un humain qui se nourrit de sang vampirique afin de ne pas vieillir : bien entendu, le vampire demande en échange de menus services à celui qui devient rapidement son serviteur (le sang de vampire est extrêmement addictif).} de surveiller le supplicié, et tous allèrent se coucher en riant -- pour ma part, je priais Dieu d’accueillir en Lui son humble serviteur sacrifié par ces païens, et de me pardonner pour cette trahison et ce manque de foi. Mais Pierre lui-même n’avait-il pas renié son Seigneur trois fois ? Au réveil, il ne restait plus de l’homme qu''un tas de cendre que le vent avait déjà dispersé...\n\nCette vindicte populaire me conforta dans mes croyances : nous étions maudits, et nous avions un prix à payer. Dieu nous avait envoyé pour sauver le monde et acquérir au prix fort notre rédemption : si tel était Son choix, je m’y soumettais volontiers. Je demandais à prendre une part plus active dans la communauté \\LS, veillant à ce que personne -- surtout \\T\\,-- n''en sache rien. C’est ainsi que je rencontrai le chef de la résistance chrétienne, un monument mythique présent depuis de nombreuse années à \\LUG : l’\\AN. Quelques années après ma naissance, la rumeur avait couru que \\G le militaire l''avait tué. Rumeur rapidement démentie : l''\\AN était réapparu publiquement quelques jours après. L’homme devint mon guide spirituel, mon maître à penser. Il m’aida à trouver l’équilibre entre mon pouvoir au \\SX et ma foi : selon lui, Dieu m’avait donné de la puissance, et je me devais de l’utiliser. Il me donnait des petites missions et je soupçonne qu''il ait eu -- et a encore -- une place proéminente dans la hiérarchie vampirique de la ville. Je n''ai jamais pu le confirmer, mais il ne m''étonnerait pas qu''il ait un siège au \\SX, et qu’il cache son jeu parmi les six autres... Son charisme était exceptionnel, et il parlait bien, voire très bien : il savait captiver une foule pour leur raconter la vie des apôtres, ou leur expliquer que nos souffrances sur cette Terre seraient récompensées plus tard dans les Cieux.\n\nParallèlement à cette vie secrète, j''apprenais à comploter, à monter des intrigues. Je gagnais en puissance, en influence : je me faisais ma place sous la blafarde lueur sélénite. Mes terrains de chasse grandissaient, mon troupeau\\footnote{Les vampires influents se voient attribuer un troupeau : un groupe d''humains dans lequel il peuvent se nourrir facilement ; évitant ainsi d''avoir à chasser.} aussi. Ma voix et mes arguments prenaient du poids lors des discussions du \\SX...\n\nEt puis vint la catastrophe. Suite à on ne sait trop quel événement, les autorités mortelles arrêtèrent toute une communauté de chrétiens.\\\\\nEt les exécutèrent.\\\\\nLa frénésie s''empara de la ville et des vampires : chacun voulait chasser le chrétien, débarrasser la civilisation romaine de cette religion qui s''accrochait et progressait insidieusement, méprisant si ouvertement l''empereur et ses dieux. Deux chasseurs se distinguaient en particulier, \\J et \\G. Le premier y mettait une ardeur perverse et semblait prendre plaisir à infliger de telles souffrances,  le second s''octroyait le soutien de la \\LM -- la force armée du \\SX\\,-- pour mener à bien ses missions dévastatrices. \\J en particulier eut un coup d’éclat illégal  : profitant de ses talents d’orateur, il rallia autour de lui toute une communauté de catholiques mortels auxquels il promettait monts et merveilles. Il créa ainsi une assemblée passionnée qui attirait les amis, puis les amis des amis, dans un groupe de plus en plus nombreux et de plus en plus fanatique. Quand il estima avoir assez d’hommes et de femmes dans ce qu’il appelait sa secte, il fit croire que le Seigneur lui avait parlé pour lui annoncer son retour parmi les humains : il réapparaîtrait dans une cave d’une des immenses villas lyonnaises. Le mot circula, et le jour dit, de nombreuses personnes entrèrent dans la cave pour glorifier Jésus. Mais \\J barricada la cave et mit le feu à la maison, tuant hommes, femmes et enfants sans distinction. Alertée, la communauté de vampires dut réagir pour cette infraction à ses lois\\footnote{Un vampire ne doit pas dévoiler l’existence du clan à un mortel.}. \\J sut plaider sa cause et s’excuser : il n’eut de toute façon pas trop à faire, ayant gagné de nombreux admirateurs dans son action.\n\nTrois mois après cette épuration religieuse (et six mois après la première rafle) une seconde vague d’arrestation eut lieu. Cette fois, il s''agissait d''une communauté massive parmi laquelle une mortelle se distinguait. Prénommée \\B, on la disait en contact direct avec le Dieu des chrétiens. Effectivement, j’avais entendu parler d’elle : je l’avais même vu pendant l’une de nos célébrations parler comme habitée par l’Esprit Saint. Le \\L mortel décida d’infliger à ces “païens” un châtiment exemplaire en les livrant aux lions ; l’exécution devait avoir lieu quelques jours plus tard dans l''arène, au milieu de la population réunie. Les vampires voulurent assister à l’événement : ils firent jouer leurs relations et le "spectacle" fut décalé en début de soirée. Je pris mon courage à deux mains pour aller visiter les geôles avant le sinistre événement, prenant bien garde à ne pas me faire voir par quiconque. J''ensorcelais alors les chrétiens prisonniers pour qu''ils abandonnent toute crainte de la mort et décèdent dans la dignité. Les humains sont facilement influençables : il me suffit de quelques sortilèges découverts à la \\LS\\footnote{La \\LS est connue pour enseigner à ses adeptes une mystérieuse sorcellerie thébaine, dont l''origine même du nom reste inconnue au profane.} pour hypnotiser le groupe. Ce n''était pas très utile, mais je ne pouvais pas les libérer. Au moins mourraient-ils en martyrs pour la cause, créant probablement de nouvelles conversions qui viendraient remplir le vide laissé.  Lorsque je rejoignis les bancs de pierre du cirque, nous n''attendions plus que \\T. Comme tout \\L qui se respecte, il se faisait un devoir d''arriver en retard à chaque événement pour se laisser désirer.\\\\\nJ''aurais voulu ne pas avoir à revenir sur le spectacle en lui-même -- on peut mourir avec dignité mangé par des lions, mais on ne peut pas mourir proprement -- cependant un événement se doit d''être mentionné : les lions mangèrent (massacrèrent serait plus approprié) tous les chrétiens, à l''exception de \\B. Pire ! Ils se couchèrent à ses pieds. Le cirque hurla au scandale, une gigantesque clameur obligea les dirigeants à récupérer Blandine pour l''emprisonner de nouveau afin de comprendre ce miracle.\nDans notre coin de l''amphithéâtre, les discussions allaient bon train : les vampires venaient d''assister à un miracle qu''ils ne pouvaient s''expliquer... Seul, \\J, l''aveugle, souriait d''un air absent, comme s''il connectait toutes les pièces d''un puzzle. Ses lèvres retroussées lui donnaient le profil d’un prédateur, et je ne pouvais m’empêcher de craindre ce qui se passait dans son esprit tortueux si dangereux pour notre communauté. Puis, se levant, il réclama d''un geste impérial le silence qui se fit aussitôt dans la loge vampirique. "Je souhaiterais", dit-il, "profiter de la prochaine réunion du \\SX, dans trois jours, pour porter une accusation. Je sais qui est l''\\AN. Et j''apporterais toutes les preuves nécessaires lors de cette réunion."\n\nLa déclaration fut bien entendu suivie d''un tollé général, de questions plus ou moins pertinentes... Mais \\J refusa d''en dire plus et se retira pour la nuit, laissant les autres curieux et moi morte d''inquiétude.\n\nIl allait me falloir un plan.\\\\\nEn sortant du cirque, je pris \\A entre quatre yeux. Il était le seul à ne pas avoir une prestance de Romain, ce qui le rapprochait de moi et de ma lignée maudite, nous permettant d''entretenir des liens d''amitié -- autant que cela peut se faire entre deux êtres assoiffés de pouvoir.\\\\\n--- Ce n''est un secret pour personne que \\J irrite en permanence le \\CP dont tu as la charge.\n\nEffectivement, tout le monde connaissait la rivalité entre \\J et \\A sur ce point. Le \\CP ? Une assemblée de vampires qui n''ont pas leur voix au \\SX. La plèbe en quelque sorte : les barbares étreints sur place (comme \\A), les nobles déchus, les faibles et les miséreux.\nIl ne dit pas mot, mais ses yeux lançaient des éclairs. Je m''avançai.\\\\\n--- Je te propose de profiter du trouble que le \\Q vient de semer pour le faire disparaître. S''il meurt maintenant, tout le monde pensera que c''est l''\\AN qui l''a réduit au silence. Je pense avoir acquis assez d''influence pour pouvoir me porter candidate au poste de \\Q devenu vacant avec sa disparition. Un poste qui, comme tu le sais, me permettra de réattribuer de façon plus équitable les terres et terrains de chasse de tes ouailles.\n\nIl ne disait toujours rien, mais son regard trahissait son intérêt. La ruse était certes grosse, mais il n''était qu''un barbare par forcément reconnu pour sa subtilité. Et si, en sauvant l''\\AN, je pouvais y gagner du pouvoir, je n''allais sûrement pas reculer. Je continuais donc sans attendre de réponse :\\\\\n--- Je ne peux malheureusement pas me charger de le faire disparaître seule. D''abord, je suis trop jeune pour avoir la force d''éliminer un tel vampire. Ensuite je n''ai pas les appuis dont tu disposes dans ce genre de... milieu. Voilà ma proposition : tu fais en sorte d''éliminer \\J rapidement et de me soutenir lors du vote qui aura lieu pour élire son remplaçant ; en contrepartie, je te donne les terrains que tu demandes.\n\nIl réfléchit, puis posa la question que j''attendais :\\\\\n--- Et pourquoi ce ne serait pas moi qui deviendrais \\Q ?\\\\\n--- D’abord, tu es déjà magistrat pour le \\CP. Ensuite, le cumul de mandat n''est autorisé que sur dérogation expresse du \\L. Légat qui m''a d''ailleurs "à la bonne"...\n\nIl souleva d''autres problèmes que je balayais rapidement. En moins d''une heure, notre accord était scellé...\n\nIl restait encore du temps avant que le coq ne chante l''heure d''aller dormir : je me rendais à ma communauté religieuse pour me recueillir sur les âmes des martyrs défunts. Là, une surprise m''attendait : l''\\AN en personne, toujours dissimulé derrière sa robe, parlant d''une voix grave qui atteignait directement mon cœur.\\\\\n--- \\V... j''ai un service à te demander. Demain a lieu chez l’\\AE de la ville, \\CAE la fête d''Aulus Julius Senex\\footnote{Aulus Julius Senex est le fondateur mythique de la \\CAM romaine. On dit qu''il dort encore dans une cave de la ville éternelle, attendant son heure pour venir constater l''aboutissement de ses rêves.}. Un rituel aura lieu dans le petit sanctuaire en son honneur... à ce moment là, il faudra que tu lances une des chandelles qui éclairera la salle sur la personne qui portera une robe munie d''une épingle comme celle-ci. M''as-tu compris ?\n\nJe hochais la tête. Il reprit d’un ton professionnel et détaché :\\\\\n--- As-tu des questions ?\\\\\n--- Non.\\\\\n--- Parfait alors. Nous nous reverrons le soir de cet évènement.\n\nEt sur ces paroles, il disparut.\\\\\nJ''étais bien entendu apeurée en me rendant chez \\CAE le lendemain (la veille de la réunion du \\SX). Encore une fois, j''arrivais avant-dernière, le \\L manquant à l''appel. En revanche, un invité inconnu était présent : on me le présenta comme \\P, infant de \\J de passage à \\LUG pour visiter son père. Un Romain que je dirais stéréotypé, sur lequel je ne m''attardais d''ailleurs pas ayant des choses plus importantes à considérer.\n\nIl fallut de nouveau attendre le \\L pour commencer. Finalement, la fête débuta : elle avait lieu tous les ans, et je commençais à en connaître les détails. Nous nous rendîmes dans le vestibule pour nous changer ; chacun enfila la robe placée dans un casier à son nom. Je surveillais du coin de l''œil chacun des vêtements, pour enfin trouver l''épingle : elle était, sans que cela ne me surprenne vraiment, sur la robe de \\J, celui qui voulait dénoncer l''\\AN le lendemain. Pendant un instant, je pensais qu''un tel échange de robes impliquait la complicité de \\CAE, la maîtresse de maison, avant de me rendre compte que n''importe quel invité aurait pu descendre à tout moment pour venir placer cette épingle.\n\nNous entrâmes dans le vestibule, \\P passant en dernier et fermant la porte derrière nous, plongeant la salle dans la pénombre, uniquement éclairée par quelques chandelles près desquelles je me plaçais. \\CAY, à demi nue, commença à sanctifier ses dieux païens et à réciter des prières latines. La capuche de la robe masquait le visage de chacun, m''assurant l''anonymat nécessaire à ma situation. Je restais indécise de longues minutes, ne sachant comment effectuer le mouvement sans me faire repérer. Soudain, \\CAY hurla ; un bruit métallique retentit. Mue par l''instinct, je lançais ma chandelle de toutes mes forces sur la robe repérée, qui s''enflamma d''un bloc -- bien trop rapidement pour du tissu d''ailleurs.\n\nLa vue du feu est une épreuve terrible pour un vampire ; surtout quand il est dans une pièce fermée. Je quittais la pièce rapidement avant que tout cela ne dégénère ; rapidement suivie par d''autres effrayés. À l''intérieur, la frénésie s''empara de chacun : le feu devait se propager aux robes, et chacun tentait d''atteindre la sortie... nous vîmes \\G sortir et se jeter dans la fontaine à l''entrée pour éteindre sa manche enflammée ; il était comme fou et ressemblait à une bête sauvage acculée. Finalement, \\J sortit, toujours embrasé. Il tomba à nos pieds, aucun de nous n''osant parler. La tension retomba, le feu s''éteignit : déjà \\J n''était plus qu''un amas de cendres prenant vaguement la forme de son corps.\n\nDans la panique qui résulta de cette mort terrible, seul \\T conserva son calme. Pragmatique, il s''avança pour constater le décès.\\\\\n--- Je crois, \\AE, que nous allons avoir besoin d''élire un nouveau \\Q. Il faudra aussi réattribuer le refuge, les terres et le troupeau du défunt. Cela nous donnera de quoi débattre, puisque l''ordre du jour demandé par \\J me semble maintenant... insoluble.\n\nIl attendit pour voir si quelqu''un se manifestait, mais nous étions tous silencieux.\\\\\n--- \\G, je pense que nous avons ici affaire à un meurtre... puis-je compter sur vous pour le résoudre ?\n\nPuis, se tournant vers nous :\\\\\n--- Vous comprendrez qu''une enquête doit se faire... je demanderais donc à ce que personne ne quitte la résidence tant que cette histoire n''est pas tirée au clair.\n\nHum. Je crois que j''ai un problème.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\nTandis que \\G amène \\CAE pour l''interroger, je fais le tour de mes options.\nFuir est hors de question : hors de la \\CAM, je ne suis qu''une vampire sans pouvoir ; ici au moins, je dispose d''une structure qui me supporte et me laisse une marge de manœuvre pour progresser.\n\nSolution la plus simple : mentir à \\G. Je dispose d''une bonne partie de la soirée pour trouver une histoire crédible avant d''être interrogée : pourquoi ne pas mettre à profit le bruit métallique entendu juste avant par exemple ? Je pourrais aussi faire plonger \\A, qui a signé un contrat pour se débarrasser de \\J. Sauf qu''il trahirait probablement notre accord pendant l''interrogatoire qui s''ensuivrait inévitablement.\nEn revanche, je peux jouer l''ingénue avec lui pour tenter d''en savoir plus...\n\n--- \\A ? Un mot en privé, s''il te plaît ?\\\\\nLe barbare me suit docilement, l''air curieux. Tous les deux, nous ne voulons pas avoir l''air de comploter : aussi nous parlons brièvement en échangeant le plus rapidement possible les informations.\\\\\n--- Je vois que tu as fait du bon boulot. Notre marché tient toujours ?\\\\\n--- Ah ! Rappelle-moi les termes exacts de ce marché ?\\\\\nJe m''approche de son oreille pour éviter d''être entendue.\\\\\n--- Tu te débarrasses de \\J, et en contrepartie je me fais élire \\Q et accorde plus de terres au \\CP.\\\\\n--- Nous sommes bien d''accord, fait-il distraitement en regardant dans la direction de \\P. Ce marché tient bien, mais j''ai comme qui dirait un autre problème... vois-tu, l''homme ici qui se fait passer pour \\P n''est pas l''infant de \\J. Il s''agirait en fait d''un certain \\CONS, d''après mes espions. Ce \\CONS est l''ennemi du vrai \\P, une raclure prête à tout pour prendre du pouvoir ; un chasseur de chrétiens violent et sans pitié. Je n''arrive pas à comprendre sa présence ici, à la place de son ennemi. Que vient-il faire à \\LUG ? Oh, et inutile de préciser qu''il ne faut rien ébruiter avant que je puisse le confronter formellement...\n\nSa remarque me fait observer l''inconnu avec plus d''attention. Il est en train de discuter avec \\CAY dans ce qui semble être une conversation difficile ; ses cheveux châtains et son port altier l''identifient clairement comme membre de l''élite romaine. Un nouveau chasseur de chrétiens ? Voilà qui vient encore complexifier mes affaires...\\\\\n--- Merci pour l''info. Concernant les futurs votes, que comptes-tu faire ? Tu as des ambitions ?\\\\\n--- Oui. J''aimerais récupérer le \\CAN, on trouve dessus des fumeries de chanvre que mes hommes fréquentent assidûment. Posséder les lieux m''évitera de payer le propriétaire...\n\nParfait. Si cette grosse brute récupère le \\CAN, je pourrais protéger les chrétiens de la chapelle sur les terres. Il est plus facile de manipuler un barbare sans subtilité que le responsable de la chasse aux chrétiens ! \\\\\n-- Mais il y a une chose plus importante encore dont je voudrais te parler. Dans le sanctuaire, avant le meurtre... quelqu''un a essayé de me tuer. J''ai vu une lame qui se dirigeait vers moi ; entendu \\CAY hurler ; puis le geste de mon agresseur s’est arrêté et l''arme est tombée avec fracas. Je n''ai pas eu le temps de réagir ou de me défendre, puisque la chandelle a volé juste après... mais quelqu''un ici souhaite me voir disparaître.\n\nIl ne le dit pas, mais je sais qu''il pense à \\G. Il y a quelques mois, le magistrat de la \\LM est tombé dans une embuscade montée par le \\CP. Il s''en est sorti de justesse, et n''a jamais pu prouver qu''\\A était derrière tout ça. Bien évidemment, cet événement n''a pas arrangé les relations entre le \\CP et la \\LM, déjà bien tendues comme il se doit entre la plèbe et les militaires. \\A ne m''a jamais avoué être l’instigateur de cette embuscade, mais à sa place je ne ferais confiance à personne non plus. Cela dit, \\G est un homme d''honneur, et je ne le vois pas s''abaisser à de telles fourberies pour faire disparaître un ennemi politique.\n\nJe le quitte pour ne pas paraître suspecte en restant à l’écart à comploter, et rejoint \\T. Je l''ai toujours soupçonné d''être l''\\AN : il en a les capacités, et par élimination il semble le mieux placé.\nJe sais que je ne le suis pas ; \\CAE est bien trop coincée pour ça, elle qui refuse même de toucher ses esclaves et s''astreint à porter des gants pour ne pas souiller sa peau ; \\G est trop chasseur de chrétiens ; \\CAY n''a clairement pas le profil, occupée qu''elle est avec sa religion ; \\A est trop bête pour mener à bien un complot d''une telle envergure. Ne reste plus que \\T... et si, comme je le pense, il est \\AN, il va avoir besoin de mon aide.\\\\\n--- \\T ! Quelle soirée ! Décidément, l''\\AN ne manque pas de ressources. Faire assassiner \\J dans la demeure même de l''\\AE, voilà qui demande un certain culot ! Mais j''imagine que cette disparition prouve qu''il se sent acculé, peut-être que \\J avait même des preuves pour étayer son accusation dans son \\COL ! Le voilà en mauvaise posture... et bientôt, nous saurons qui se cache sous le masque !\\\\\nJe scanne son visage, à la recherche de la moindre émotion, du plus petit regard de connivence provoqué par mon discours volontairement ambigu... mais non, rien.\\\\\n--- Une vraie tragédie, effectivement. Encore que, cela nous donne l''occasion de te propulser au poste de \\Q.\\\\\nVoilà bien mon \\T. Détaché et pragmatique.\\\\\n--- Effectivement. Je pense que nous pouvons d''ailleurs ajouter dans notre combine \\A, qui m''a promis sa voix en échange de mon vote contre le \\CAN.\n\nC''est bien entendu une certaine distance que je prends avec la réalité, mais \\T n''a pas à tout savoir. L''expérience m''a appris à ne jamais placer tous mes œufs dans le même panier. \\T reprend :\\\\\n--- Voilà qui me donne une idée. Nous somme six à voter, ainsi que \\P qui dispose bien entendu d''un siège au \\SX de notre ville en tant que magistrat romain en déplacement. Sept personnes, il suffit donc d''être quatre pour obtenir une majorité partout. Et cela tombe bien, il y a quatre lots... je suis personnellement attiré par le \\COL. Toi, par le poste de \\Q. \\A par le \\CAN. Il ne reste plus qu''à trouver un quatrième homme intéressé par le troupeau, et nous avons la majorité des voix. La magie de la démocratie...\n\nIl s''interrompt sur ces paroles : \\CAY semble avoir fini sa discussion avec \\P et tous deux nous rejoignent. Je pourrais prévenir \\T de ce qu''\\A m''a dit concernant \\P... mais je n''y gagne rien ; autant attendre que l''information soit monnayable. D''ailleurs, en y pensant \\CAY sera probablement intéressée par le troupeau de \\J, pour ses sacrifices aux dieux ; elle pourrait être le quatrième larron que nous venons d''évoquer ! Il me faudra lui en parler... même si nos rapports sont assez froids, ce qui s''explique facilement : je fais rarement des offrandes à son culte et ses dieux païens.\\\\\n--- \\CAY ! Quel plaisir de vous voir !\n\nMa langue me brûle de prononcer de telles paroles ; mais mieux vaut ne pas afficher au grand jour mon mépris des dieux tutélaires.\\\\\n--- Un plaisir ? Mais ma petite \\V, nous pourrions l''avoir bien plus souvent si vous passiez plus fréquemment dans nos temples faire des offrandes aux dieux...\n\nTouchée. Elle ne semble pas d’humeur à discuter calmement : on dirait presque qu’elle vient de pleurer. Heureusement, \\T intervient :\\\\\n--- Allons, pas de chamailleries. L''heure est grave. \\CAY, pourriez-vous nous décrire les événements de votre point de vue ? Je me souviens vous avoir entendu hurler avant que cette bougie ne s''envole ; auriez-vous vu l''assassin ?\\\\\n--- Hé bien... non, pas vraiment. J''incantais auprès de mon autel quand un reflet retint mon attention : c''était, j''en mettrais ma main à couper, une lame ! et qui se dirigeait vers un des nôtres ! J''ai hurlé pour l''avertir, le mouvement s''est arrêté et le reflet a disparu... et après je ne me souviens plus de rien.\n\nJe renchéris ironiquement :\\\\\n--- Quel dommage ! Mais on ne peut pas vous en vouloir : vous n''êtes que prêtresse du culte des augures, pas une militaire formée à ce genre de choses.\\\\\n--- Pardon ?\n\nElle semble réellement choquée par mes propos, aussi je ne dis plus rien. Cela ne suffit pas à la calmer, puisqu''elle nous lance un “bonsoir” glacial avant de quitter notre compagnie. \\T en profite pour s''éclipser aussi, me laissant seul avec \\P. Le moment idéal pour lancer une discussion et tirer les choses au clair sur ce nouvel arrivant : je décide d’attaquer franchement, en lui montrant dès la première phrase que je sais qui il est.\\\\\n--- Bonjour, \\P... ou peut-être devrais-je dire \\CONS  ?\n\nUne nouvelle fois, je scrute son visage à la recherche de la moindre émotion. Il semble surpris, mais pas la surprise de celui qui est découvert ; plus celle de celui qui ne comprend pas ce qui se passe. Dans le doute, j''enchaîne donc comme si de rien n''était :\\\\\n--- J''ai cru voir que tu as eu une altercation avec ton père \\J, juste avant d''entrer dans le sanctuaire ? Rien de grave j''espère ?\n\nUn bon moyen de lui mettre subtilement la pression, basé tout de même sur un fond de vérité : étant l''une des dernières à pénétrer dans les lieux, j''avais pu le voir discuter avec \\J auprès des casiers qui contenaient les robes. Ce n''était pas une dispute, juste quelques phrases que je n''avais d''ailleurs pas entendues ; mais pour l’intérêt de l’argument, je dramatise la chose.\\\\\n--- Ah ? Ce n''était pourtant pas un véritable échange de mots... juste une discussion avec mon père, que je n''avais plus vu depuis cinquante ans et avec qui je ne communique plus depuis bientôt dix-huit ans ! Et non, pour répondre à cette question implicite, ce n''est pas moi qui l''ai tué. Éclaire-moi : tu es bien \\V ? J''aurais des choses importantes à te dire... je sais par exemple que tu es chrétienne.\n\nJe maîtrise mon visage pour ne montrer aucune émotion. Dans son dos apparaît \\G, qui s''approche à grands pas de notre couple. Le regard du militaire est posé sur moi ; si j''étais encore humaine je sentirais l''adrénaline m''envahir. Mais non, je suis une vampire et je l''observe approcher de façon impassible ; quoiqu''à l''intérieur mes pensées bouillonnent. \\textit{Déjà démasquée ? Merde. Qui a pu me trahir ? Qui savait ? Serait-ce l''\\AN qui se débarrasse ainsi de moi ? Pourquoi ? M''a-t-on vu lancer la bougie ? Pourrais-je soudoyer \\G ? Et \\P, comment sait-il ? Est-ce un bluff ? A-t-il des preuves ? Pourquoi ne me dénonce-t-il pas ? Il veut me faire chanter ?}\\\\\n--- Dame \\V, veuillez me suivre... j''ai quelques questions à vous poser. Personnellement.\n\nIl appuie son dernier mot d''un regard à \\P.\\\\\n--- D''ailleurs, \\P, sachez que j''appréciais énormément votre père. Je vous soutiendrais donc inconditionnellement pour que vous récupériez ses possessions et ses titres.\n\nIl ne me reste plus qu''à lui emboîter le pas, mes questions sans réponses continuant de tourbillonner dans mon esprit.\n\n\\G me mène jusqu''à la salle d''interrogatoire, une des chambres de la villa de \\CAE dans laquelle il a installé des chaises et un bureau. Quand il ouvre la porte, je vois que \\CAY est déjà là.\\\\\n--- \\V, \\CAY ici présente vous accuse de blasphème. C''est une accusation extrêmement grave, avez-vous quelque chose à dire pour votre défense ?\n\nSa remarque me prend par surprise : je m’attendais à tout sauf à cela.\\\\\n--- Blasphème ? Mais... qu''ai-je dit ?\\\\\n--- Vous m''avez dénigrée publiquement ! Vous avez sous-entendu que j''étais inférieure !\n\nJe comprends soudain que je n''ai pas encore été découverte ; c''est ma remarque acerbe qui me vaut cet interrogatoire. Intérieurement soulagée, je réfléchis à ma meilleure ligne de défense. Elle a tout à fait raison : j''ai bien sous-entendu cela. Mais je ne vais bien évidemment pas le reconnaître devant \\G. Et la beauté des sous-entendus, c''est qu''on peut nier avoir voulu les faire.\\\\\n--- Oh ! Je suis désolée... je vois qu''il y a eu incompréhension ! Je n''ai jamais dit -- ni même pensé ! -- une telle chose ! Je supposais simplement à haute voix qu''un militaire en votre place aurait pu arrêter le meurtrier potentiel. Mais je comprends tout à fait que vous ayez eu peur ; j''aurais moi même réagi de façon identique. Votre comportement est au contraire exemplaire : vous avez pu sauver la pauvre victime et arrêter l''assassin. C''est la seule chose que je souhaitais dire, et j''ai honte de voir que ma phrase n''était pas claire... pourrez-vous m''en excuser ?\\\\\n--- Oh ! Oui... bien sûr, ce n''est qu''une simple incompréhension ! \\G, veuillez m''excuser pour le dérangement...\\\\\n--- Il n''y a pas de souci madame ; nous sommes là pour ça. Content de voir la situation éclaircie... \\CAY, pouvez-vous rester afin que je vous pose quelques questions ? \\V, je vous verrai après.\\\\\n\nJe ne m''attarde pas sur les lieux, j''ai un autre gros problème à résoudre. Comment \\P sait-il que je suis chrétienne ? Avec les informations d''\\A sur la dualité \\P et \\CONS, je crains le pire...\\\\\nDe retour dans le jardin, il m''est facile de le rejoindre. Je l''entraîne un peu à l''écart\\footnote{Les vampires ont une excellente ouïe, ce qui impose de s''éloigner de plusieurs dizaines de mètres lorsque l''on souhaite discuter en privé. C''est aussi un bon moyen d''isoler quelqu''un pour s''en débarrasser...}, nos affaires nécessitant une certaine privauté.\\\\\n--- Tu me dis chrétienne  ? Allons bon, tu arrives en ville et la première chose qui te vient à l''esprit c''est d''accuser les gens ? D''autant que ce n''est pas une simple insinuation, c''est une accusation en bonne et due forme ! Je pourrais te dénoncer devant le \\SX. Tu as de la chance d''avoir tenté ton grossier manège sur moi ; je n''ai pas la dent dure. Je frémis en pensant à ce qui aurait pu t''arriver si tu avais dit la même chose à \\CAE...\\\\\n--- Non ! Tu ne comprends pas... je sais que tu es chrétienne !\n\nQuelle ruse grossière. Un ennemi puissant, ce \\CONS d''après \\A ? Pour l''instant, il semble bien inoffensif... mais il me faut vérifier que ses crocs sont bien limés -- au figuré.\\\\\n--- Bien sûr ! Et je suppose que tu as des preuves ?\\\\\n--- Euh... non. Mais je le sais !\\\\\n--- Tu n''y comprends vraiment rien ! Tu ne peux pas arriver et accuser quelqu''un sans preuve ! La simple connaissance ne suffit pas. Regarde-moi : je peux très bien dire que toi aussi tu es chrétien, ça ne prouve rien !\\\\\n--- Mais c''est le cas. Je suis chrétien.\n\nAh. Là, je reste la bouche ouverte pendant quelques secondes, en cherchant désespérément quelque chose à dire. Il est chrétien ? Pourquoi me le dire, alors que je viens de nier devant lui ? Pourquoi mettre sa vie entre mes mains ? À moins qu''il ne s''agisse d''un grossier mensonge dans le but de me faire avouer par sollicitude...\\\\\n--- Je ne te crois pas. Tu essaies juste de confirmer ce que tu “sais”, mais tu n''es pas chrétien. Je parie que les chrétiens ont un signe de ralliement, saurais-tu le reproduire ?\n\nIl regarde autour de lui et semble hésiter, puis se décide. Du bout du doigt, il dessine un poisson dans l''herbe... c''est effectivement un symbole chrétien, mais n''importe quel infiltré de bas niveau le saurait.\\\\\n-- À ton tour maintenant.\n\nPour faire bonne mesure, je reproduis exactement le même symbole devant lui. Ainsi, en cas de procès je pourrais dire que je n''ai fait que copier dans le but d''infiltrer les chrétiens... et cela laisse \\P (ou qui qu''il soit) dans le doute. À tel point qu''il ne sait plus que faire et reste pensif, probablement à chercher un moyen de me duper pour me prouver sa ``bonne foi''''.\\\\\nAu loin, \\G m''appelle de nouveau : une excellente excuse pour fausser compagnie à l’homme et quitter la discussion qui devenait réellement dangereuse.\n\nÀ l''entrée de la salle d’interrogatoire, je recroise \\CAY.\\\\\n--- Tu as parlé avec \\MAX ? N''essaie pas de le séduire ! C''est moi qu''il est venu chercher ! Moi et moi seule !\\\\\nElle est anormalement agressive. Je me retourne pour voir de qui elle parle : seul \\P est visible... \\MAX ? Qui c''est celui-là ? Mais je n''ai pas le temps d''enquêter : je rentre dans le bureau et ferme la porte derrière moi, m''enfermant avec \\G.\\\\\n--- \\V. Tu es là pour faire ta déposition concernant le meutre du \\Q \\J. Qu''as-tu vu dans cette soirée ?\n\nAvec tous ces évènements, je n’ai pas eu le temps de peaufiner mon alibi. J’invente donc au fur et à mesure :\\\\\n--- Hé bien... j''ai vu que \\P s''est disputé avec son père juste avant d''entrer... Pendant la cérémonie, j''ai aussi remarqué un reflet métallique ; suivi par le cri de \\CAY. Et puis... tout est allé très vite ! La bougie qui vole, le feu... je suis sortie le plus rapidement possible, sans chercher à comprendre.\n\nHop, j''ai volé l''histoire de \\CAY : ainsi, ma déposition se recoupe avec la sienne ce qui donne aux deux témoignages plus de crédibilité -- ce dont j''ai justement besoin. Pour faire encore plus vrai, j''ai hésité sur de nombreux points et donné les faits dans un ordre décousu, comme pour prouver que je ne cachais rien.\\\\\n--- Aurais-tu d''autres informations à me donner ? Une idée de qui aurait pu avoir envie de faire ça ?\\\\\nJe m''attendais à cette question. Je pourrais lui dire qu''une rumeur apprise de "mes" chrétiens dit qu''\\A aurait violé \\CAY et qu''elle cherche à se venger depuis. Que \\T et lui semblent entretenir une relation perverse depuis de nombreuses années et font tout pour garder ça secret. Que \\CAE semble être contrainte par \\J (je les ai vu il y a quelques mois... une discussion enflammée dans laquelle \\CAE s''est retrouvée à devoir supporter un point de vue qu''elle ne partage absolument pas suite à un coup d''œil du \\Q). Que \\P semble être chrétien. Mais tout ça, il n''a pas à le savoir. Je préfère rester normale, ne pas m''avancer.\\\\\n--- Hé bien... on m''a dit que \\CAY manquait d''humains à sacrifier. Récupérer le troupeau de \\J lui sera probablement d''une grande utilité.\\\\\n--- Vous l’accusez d’avoir commis le meurtre pour récupérer quelques humains ?\\\\\n--- Grand dieux non ! Je vous en informais juste !\n\n\\G me fixe intensément. Puis il me remercie et me donne congé, avant d''appeler \\P.\n\nJe me retrouve seule à penser. Devenir \\Q me semble un objectif à ma hauteur, mais l’apparition de \\P et de ses informations risque de tout compromettre. Qui a bien pu me trahir en tant que chrétienne ? Seul l’\\AN est au courant, mais je le sers fidèlement : pourquoi se débarrasser de moi maintenant ?\\\\\nÀ sa sortie de la salle d’interrogatoire, \\P vient me rejoindre pour clore notre discussion.\\\\\n--- J''ai décidé d''être honnête avec toi. Je suis vraiment chrétien, et nous devons nous aider.\n\nIl commence à me réciter des prières en latin. Cette fois, il aurait fallu être très bien infiltré pour y avoir eu accès. Il continue :\\\\\n--- Je ne m''appelle pas \\P. Mon vrai nom est \\S. Et je suis un assassin.\n\nJ''ai presque envie de rire :  on l''appelle \\P, \\A le prend pour \\CONS, \\CAY l''appelle étrangement \\MAX... et le voilà qui me sort tout naturellement un quatrième nom. Cet homme ne manque décidément pas de culot. Mais je préfère ne rien dire ; il a l''air parti pour parler et son histoire, à défaut d''être crédible, semble intéressante.\\\\\n--- J''ai été embauché il y a quelques mois pour assassiner \\J. J''ai pris la place de \\P il y a quelques heures, mettant en torpeur\\footnote{La torpeur est l''état dans lequel se trouve un vampire encore plus mort que d''habitude (pieu dans le cœur, vidé de tout son sang...). Le vampire dans cet état est amorphe ; pour le “réveiller” il faudra lui donner du sang ou retirer le pieu qui bloque ses fonctions “vitales”. Si personne ne fait rien, la torpeur peut durer des millénaires...\\\\\nLa mise en torpeur n''est pas illégale -- mais très mal vue --, en revanche tuer véritablement un vampire l''est (en détachant la tête d''un vampire en Torpeur, ou en le faisant brûler). Pire encore, on raconte que certains aspirent l''âme d''un vampire en Torpeur pour récupérer son expérience et sa puissance sanguine. Nommée \\textit{diablerie}, il s''agit d''une discipline prohibée au plus haut point qui détruit le vampire diablerisé et affecte profondément l''esprit du diableriste.} le vrai \\P qui venait réellement rendre visite à son père. Quelqu''un a laissé pour moi un glaive à l''entrée du sanctuaire pour que j''effectue mon boulot ; c''est pour ça que j''ai parlé avec \\J : afin de passer en dernier et de récupérer discrètement l''arme. Mon commanditaire -- dont j''ignore le nom -- devait placer sur la robe de \\J un anneau -- l''anneau de la guilde des assassins dont je suis membre -- pour pouvoir le distinguer facilement dans la pénombre. Au moment de frapper cette robe, je me suis rendu compte que ce n''était pas \\J, mais \\A. J''ai arrêté mon geste, laissé tomber l''arme et je n''y comprends plus rien. Comme tu vois, je te fais extrêmement confiance... j''ai besoin de ton aide ! Je veux comprendre.\n\nSa longue confession me prend par surprise. Ce qu''il dit se recoupe avec le récit d''\\A... mais pourquoi me faire confiance ? À moins qu''il ne cherche toujours à infiltrer les chrétiens lyonnais et tente de m''amadouer ainsi. Mais les soupçons qui pèsent sur lui sont trop lourds : quatre noms, voilà qui fait trop pour un seul individu. Et ce \\J ! Qui pouvait vouloir le tuer en dehors de l''\\AN ? Aurait-il engagé une deuxième équipe ? Pourquoi ne pas nous avoir donné le même signe distinctif sur les robes dans ce cas ? Et pourquoi ne pas nous avoir prévenus ?\n\n--- Peut-être... peut-être que tu étais vraiment censé tuer \\A. On t''a dit qu''on voulait tuer \\J pour que tu ne puisses pas les trahir si tu te faisais capturer avant... et on espérait que tu tuerais \\A par confusion !\\\\\n--- C''est extrêmement peu professionnel et donc peu probable. Maintenant il me faut rester pour faire semblant de pleurer mon père... et tenter de récupérer les miettes de son empire afin d''être crédible. Cela dit, j''aimerais aider les chrétiens... souhaites-tu que je vote pour toi à un moment ?\n\nIl me faut discuter avec lui de longues minutes pour le faire entrer dans la combine inventée par \\T. Au début, \\P (\\S ?) souhaite récupérer au moins le \\COL de son "père", mais je finis par le persuader de se contenter d''un peu d''or et de fuir \\LUG dès la fin des votes. Il accepte à contrecœur... et je me demande si je peux vraiment lui faire confiance.\n\nMais nos discussions sont coupées par un appel au rassemblement : c''est \\G qui est au centre du cercle.\\\\\n--- Mesdames et messieurs, je cède l''enquête sur le meurtre à \\A. J''espère qu''il saura se montrer à la hauteur et trouver le coupable.', 46052);

(3, 1, '2011-02-12 19:26:28', 'What is it?\nDaniel Day-Lewis drinks other people’s milkshakes.\n\nWhy is it great?\nTo be honest, I’ve never found the character study of Daniel Plainview fully satisfying. We learn so much about how he is but virtually nothing about why. From his initial hatred of humanity to his final descent into loner hell, we’re never given an understanding as to what’s behind it all, which I think limits the character’s impact. Still, when the movie works it really works. When you’ve got one of the best directors alive working with one of the best actors alive in an early American oil epic it’s almost hard for it not to be great. Anderson’s beautiful, patient shots and the brilliant Plainview vs. Eli Sunday scenes are going to be just as riveting 50 years from now as they are today.\n\n\n19) Super Troopers (Jay Chandrasekhar, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nA group of highway patrol officers get up to some shenanigans.\n\nWhy is it great?\nA lot of people seem to have Anchorman as one of their top movies, and for a while I was thinking of including it. Then my friend Alex shaved his beard into a moustache and I made a crack about moustache rides. Suddenly it hit me – Super Troopers is one of the best films of the decade. It has moments like its brilliant opening that can go toe-to-toe with Anchorman’s best scenes and it did a better job of not slipping into lazy, sit-comy writing. It’s smarter than Harold and Kumar, more consistent than Pineapple Express and more distinct than the pack of Judd Apatow flicks that filled the OOs. Quite simply, it’s the best stoner comedy of the decade.\n\n\n18) Spirited Away (Hayao Miyazaki, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nA little girl stumbles into a ghost world after her parents are transformed into pigs. A modern-day Alice in Wonderland follows.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThis was an enviable decade to be a kid, as many children’s movies stopped relying on clichés and Phil Collins soundtracks and started treating their audiences with respect. But the one that impressed me the most wasn’t made by Pixar. Containing more visual ideas than 10 Disney movies combined along with a universal story about childhood, Spirited Away is the best animated film of the decade.\n\n\n17) The Dark Knight (Christopher Nolan, 2008)\n\nWhat is it?\nNana nana nana nana nana nana nana nana… Batman.\n\nWhy is it great?\nI almost went with Christopher Nolan’s excellent rival magicians movie The Prestige instead, but ultimately I’ve got to hand it to The Dark Knight. Sure the whole x-ray vision stuff was goofy and there were some problems with the plot, but it deserves a spot for a few reasons. 1) It marked the growing up of super hero movies. In his flick, Spiderman had to choose between saving Mary Jane or a trolley full of people. He pulled some web bullshit and voila, everyone’s fine. Batman was given the same choice and a main character died. 2) Hack movies like Babel get fawned over for insipid themes like “not communicating is bad.” The Dark Knight deals with dark thematic issues most movies never touch, like the West’s responsibility for terrorism, deceiving the masses for their own good, love not saving anyone and the impossibility of living up to heroic expectations. 3) Incredibly memorable moments, like the bank heist opening. 4) Heath Ledger''s The Joker. Not just one of the two greatest villains of the decade, he''s one of the best all-time movie bad guys.\n\n\n16) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Michel Gondry, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nA love story told backwards as it’s forgotten.\n\nWhy is it great?\nBlah blah blah, Charlie Kaufman, blah blah, Michel Gondry, blah blah. By now everyone knows the praise for the script, visuals, and performances of this movie so I won’t rehash it here. Instead I’ll just say one thing I really respect about Eternal Sunshine is it resisted the urge to romanticize. Instead of waiting for the couple to figure out they’re obviously meant to be together, Eternal Sunshine gives us characters that probably aren’t right for each other and may well be doomed to repeat their mistakes. It’s this heavy dose of reality as much as the script and visuals that made this such a fresh viewing experience. And damn it, we’re all still rooting for Joel and Clementine.\n\n\n15) 28 Days Later (Danny Boyle, 2002)\n\nWhat is it?\nA brilliantly stylized reinvention of the zombie genre from one of film''s most versatile directors.\n\nWhy is great?\nThis is the second most important zombie movie of all time (after Night of the Living Dead, obviously). Where Romero invented the genre as we know it, Boyle reinvented it for the 21st century. But there’s so much more than just the “fast zombies” that makes this movie great. Just watch the beginning and by the haunting scene of Cilian Murphy wandering around an abandoned London you know you’ve got a classic. And yes, 28 Days Later does count as a zombie movie.\n\n\n14) Children of Men (Alfonso Cuaron, 2006)\n\nWhat is it?\nClive Own wanders the streets of a ragged, dying Britain. Children inexplicably stopped being born years ago, the youngest man in the world was just killed in a bar fight, xenophobia has manifested into a militaristic dictatorship and – oh shit, is that chick pregnant?\n\nWhy s it on the list?\nMan, these ten years were pretty thin on great sci fi movies. The 90s finished off on a high with Dark City and The Matrix then this decade tries to carry the torch with god-awful Matrix sequels and Star Wars prequels. The much championed Minority Report and Stark Trek were too shiny and pretty to be considered classics in my mind. Great sci fi should have some grit. Luckily we got quality mind-benders (Primer), space westerns (Serenity) and of course Children of Men, a story that encapsulates despair as well as any I’ve seen. Intriguing plot and strong acting aside, it’s the incredible cinematography that elevates this film to greatness. The stunning, single-shot car heist and city under siege scenes rank among the best of this generation.\n\n(Note: I’d probably have included Serenity on this list of not for that in my mind it’s inherently linked into the TV show Firefly.)\n\n\n13) Mulholland Drive (David Lynch, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nGood question.\n\nWhy is it great?\nI debated about whether to include this or the longer, stranger Lynch film Inland Empire. Neither are films you can shake out of your mind but ultimately the nod goes to Mulholland Drive. It’s hard to say how the original plan for a TV show would have gone. Instead Lynch salvaged the stillborn pilot to create an enduring work of art. A lot of movies are weird for the sake of being weird while having nothing of substance underneath (take the paper-thin Donnie Darko, maybe the most overrated movie of the decade) but here Lynch delivers something worth digging into and exploring. In the end it’s really quite a simple story, but half the fun is piecing it all together. The other half is watching it - the scene of the opera singer dropping dead during Roy Orbison’s song Crying, thus revealing everything as an illusion, is a contender for greatest scene of the decade.\n\n\n12) Lost in Translation (Sofia Coppola, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nBill Murray and Scarlett Johansson star in a surprisingly non-creepy sort of romance story about two tourists in Japan trying to figure it all out.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThe oughts had a bit of an obsession with movies about people ‘finding’ themselves. Lost in Translation was the best of the bunch and set the bar for the Junos, Little Miss Sunshines and Garden States that followed. People tend to gush over, say, holocaust movies because of their heavy subject regardless of whether they’re well made. Yet here is a movie about two upper-class people fighting ennui and through some truly graceful filmmaking we genuinely relate to and care for them. In this case less is more: Long stretches of no dialogue? Instead take in the excellent soundtrack by Air. Having no plot to speak of? Yeah, well neither does real life. Coppola mixes just the right blend of wistfulness and humour so that by the ending fade out you feel truly satisfied.\n\n\n11) Battle Royale (Kinji Fukasaku, 2000)\n\nWhat is it?\nIn a futuristic dystopian Japan, a class of grade nine students is kidnapped, taken to an island, given weapons and told they must fight to the death until only one is left alive.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nUh, did you see the premise? Usually something that sounds that batshit awesome turns out to be a heap of disappointment. Not this time. This is one movie that knows how to follow through. I sill rank the first time I saw Battle Royale in high school as one of the most mind-blowing cinema experiences of my life.\n\n\n10) Before Sunset (Richard Linklater, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nJulie Delpy and Ethan Hawke reunite 10 years after a one-night romantic tryst.\n\nWhy is it great?\n1995’s Before Sunrise was a charming film about two young people meeting randomly for one passionate night in Europe. Making a follow-up to its excellent ending – will they or won’t they fulfill their promise to meet one year later? – seemed like a terrible idea. Instead, this sequel bests its predecessor in every way. Delpy and Hawke still have some of the best on-screen chemistry ever seen, but 10 years later life has gotten complicated and their discussions have more weight. Instead of a young fairytale romance, here are two adults trying to recreate a fairytale romance. The beauty is in watching them pull it off. Linklater’s direction couldn’t be better – for a film that is basically one long string of dialogue it’s the sparse use of silence that has the most impact.\n\n\n9) Memento (Christopher Nolan, 2000)\n\nWhat is it?\nThe story of a man with no short-term memory hunting his wife’s killer. Oh, and the movie runs backwards.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nI feel a pretty deep connection to this movie. At the time of its release it was my favourite film and in many ways it sparked my love of movies. It’s not the only film to do the backwards chronology thing (2002’s Irreversible, which I painfully couldn’t fit on this list, is a notable example) but it uses it brilliantly. What could have been a gimmick becomes an incredibly fresh way to tell a dark, unforgettable story that is still captivating today. This is raw movie-making gold.\n\n\n8) Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2 (Quentin Tarantino, 2003/2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nTarantino, master of the literal title, delivers a loving homage to samurai movies.\n\nWhy is it great?\nFirst of all, it''s one big story so I''m throwing the two movies together. What''s striking about Kill Bill is that so much of it is made up of recycled parts. By assembling a mountain of shots and moments and molding them into one Power Rangersesque super movie, Tarantino has surpassed his source material. Only in Pulp Fiction has Tarantino brought style and substance together in such a dynamite package. Plus it rejuvanated David Carradine''s career, so huge bonus points.\n\n\n7) Oldboy (Chan-wook Park, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nDuring a night of heavy drinking a man is mysteriously abducted, kept captive in a hotel-style room for 15 years without explanation and then released. He immediately goes on a quest for answers - and revenge.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThank god rumours of an American remake seem to have fizzled out. There is just no way to improve upon this breathtaking film. Like Battle Royale, Oldboy takes a wicked premise and doesn''t just live up to it but exceeds it. Chan-wook Park challenges you to keep up to his winding story that ventures miles beyond what mainstream western movies would dare to touch. This is revenge cinema at its finest. It''s so good that its also having one of the best fight scenes of the decade doesn''t even seem fair.\n\n\n6) Shaun of the Dead (Edgar Wright, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nA comedy? A horror movie? A zom-com? Who knows?\n\nWhy is it great?\nSure, it’s quick and funny enough to be on the list for yuks alone. But beyond that, Shaun is actually quite groundbreaking. How many movies, if any, have managed to so finely walk a line between two disparate genres? A hilarious toss up of zombie films while at the same time being a zombie film, Shaun of the Dead is the ultimate case of having your brains and eating them too.\n\n\n5) No Country for Old Men (The Coen brothers, 2007)\n\nWhat is it?\nThe best thriller of the decade.\n\nWhy is it great?\nSuck it, Stephen Spielberg. Joel and Ethan Coen show that they are the masters of cat-and-mouse thrill ride filmmaking. Everyone brings their A game to this one. You can''t ask for better technical camerawork and editing. Its pacing is unconventional but works to a tee. The cast is excellent but the show is stolen by Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh. With the Joker, Chigurh is one two characters that elevated villainhood to new hights. And of course the star behind the screen is Cormac McCArthy, whose faithfully adapted novel this all stems from.\n\n\n4) Zodiac (David Fincher, 2007)\n\nWhat is it?\nA genre-breaking film about the real life hunt to track down the Zodiac Killer.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nCould this be the best serial killer movie ever? I guess it’s not a fair question. While most focus on the mind of the killer (take Fincher’s own Se7en), this movie is about the people hunting him. More truly, it’s about obsession. Fincher puts on an absolute clinic of filmmaking. He juggles an incredible cast of characters (especially Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr.) and a complex, weaving plot that spans decades of dead ends and false starts, yet the movie never stops being gripping. It’s a story that shouldn’t work but Fincher inverts the focus and makes this all about that wing of human nature that refuses – or isn’t able – to let things go. People who derided this film as ''slow'' need to go back and see all that''s going as they''re missing exquisite filmmaking.\n\n\n3) The Barbarian Invasions (Denys Arcand, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nA Quebecois professor is diagnosed with cancer and admitted to hospital. As the end of his life nears, his family and friends gather together to see him off.\n\nWhy is it great?\nAdmittedly, the premise makes this movie sound entirely depressing. It’s not. It’s filled with dark humour, off-colour jokes, womanizing and drug use. This makes the moments of poignancy and insight that much more powerful. Clever, debauched and somehow comforting, this is a personal fable about something we all try to do eventually - come to terms with death. This is also my favourite Canadian film, period.\n', 14398),
(4, 1, '2011-02-12 19:27:52', 'What is it?\nDaniel Day-Lewis drinks other people’s milkshakes.\n\nWhy is it great?\nTo be honest, I’ve never found the character study of Daniel Plainview fully satisfying. We learn so much about how he is but virtually nothing about why. From his initial hatred of humanity to his final descent into loner hell, we’re never given an understanding as to what’s behind it all, which I think limits the character’s impact. Still, when the movie works it really works. When you’ve got one of the best directors alive working with one of the best actors alive in an early American oil epic it’s almost hard for it not to be great. Anderson’s beautiful, patient shots and the brilliant Plainview vs. Eli Sunday scenes are going to be just as riveting 50 years from now as they are today.\n\n\n19) Super Troopers (Jay Chandrasekhar, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nA group of highway patrol officers get up to some shenanigans.\n\nWhy is it great?\nA lot of people seem to have Anchorman as one of their top movies, and for a while I was thinking of including it. Then my friend Alex shaved his beard into a moustache and I made a crack about moustache rides. Suddenly it hit me – Super Troopers is one of the best films of the decade. It has moments like its brilliant opening that can go toe-to-toe with Anchorman’s best scenes and it did a better job of not slipping into lazy, sit-comy writing. It’s smarter than Harold and Kumar, more consistent than Pineapple Express and more distinct than the pack of Judd Apatow flicks that filled the OOs. Quite simply, it’s the best stoner comedy of the decade.\n\n\n18) Spirited Away (Hayao Miyazaki, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nA little girl stumbles into a ghost world after her parents are transformed into pigs. A modern-day Alice in Wonderland follows.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThis was an enviable decade to be a kid, as many children’s movies stopped relying on clichés and Phil Collins soundtracks and started treating their audiences with respect. But the one that impressed me the most wasn’t made by Pixar. Containing more visual ideas than 10 Disney movies combined along with a universal story about childhood, Spirited Away is the best animated film of the decade.\n\n\n17) The Dark Knight (Christopher Nolan, 2008)\n\nWhat is it?\nNana nana nana nana nana nana nana nana… Batman.\n\nWhy is it great?\nI almost went with Christopher Nolan’s excellent rival magicians movie The Prestige instead, but ultimately I’ve got to hand it to The Dark Knight. Sure the whole x-ray vision stuff was goofy and there were some problems with the plot, but it deserves a spot for a few reasons. 1) It marked the growing up of super hero movies. In his flick, Spiderman had to choose between saving Mary Jane or a trolley full of people. He pulled some web bullshit and voila, everyone’s fine. Batman was given the same choice and a main character died. 2) Hack movies like Babel get fawned over for insipid themes like “not communicating is bad.” The Dark Knight deals with dark thematic issues most movies never touch, like the West’s responsibility for terrorism, deceiving the masses for their own good, love not saving anyone and the impossibility of living up to heroic expectations. 3) Incredibly memorable moments, like the bank heist opening. 4) Heath Ledger''s The Joker. Not just one of the two greatest villains of the decade, he''s one of the best all-time movie bad guys.\n\n\n16) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Michel Gondry, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nA love story told backwards as it’s forgotten.\n\nWhy is it great?\nBlah blah blah, Charlie Kaufman, blah blah, Michel Gondry, blah blah. By now everyone knows the praise for the script, visuals, and performances of this movie so I won’t rehash it here. Instead I’ll just say one thing I really respect about Eternal Sunshine is it resisted the urge to romanticize. Instead of waiting for the couple to figure out they’re obviously meant to be together, Eternal Sunshine gives us characters that probably aren’t right for each other and may well be doomed to repeat their mistakes. It’s this heavy dose of reality as much as the script and visuals that made this such a fresh viewing experience. And damn it, we’re all still rooting for Joel and Clementine.\n\n\n15) 28 Days Later (Danny Boyle, 2002)\n\nWhat is it?\nA brilliantly stylized reinvention of the zombie genre from one of film''s most versatile directors.\n\nWhy is great?\nThis is the second most important zombie movie of all time (after Night of the Living Dead, obviously). Where Romero invented the genre as we know it, Boyle reinvented it for the 21st century. But there’s so much more than just the “fast zombies” that makes this movie great. Just watch the beginning and by the haunting scene of Cilian Murphy wandering around an abandoned London you know you’ve got a classic. And yes, 28 Days Later does count as a zombie movie.\n\n\n14) Children of Men (Alfonso Cuaron, 2006)\n\nWhat is it?\nClive Own wanders the streets of a ragged, dying Britain. Children inexplicably stopped being born years ago, the youngest man in the world was just killed in a bar fight, xenophobia has manifested into a militaristic dictatorship and – oh shit, is that chick pregnant?\n\nWhy s it on the list?\nMan, these ten years were pretty thin on great sci fi movies. The 90s finished off on a high with Dark City and The Matrix then this decade tries to carry the torch with god-awful Matrix sequels and Star Wars prequels. The much championed Minority Report and Stark Trek were too shiny and pretty to be considered classics in my mind. Great sci fi should have some grit. Luckily we got quality mind-benders (Primer), space westerns (Serenity) and of course Children of Men, a story that encapsulates despair as well as any I’ve seen. Intriguing plot and strong acting aside, it’s the incredible cinematography that elevates this film to greatness. The stunning, single-shot car heist and city under siege scenes rank among the best of this generation.\n\n(Note: I’d probably have included Serenity on this list of not for that in my mind it’s inherently linked into the TV show Firefly.)\n\n\n13) Mulholland Drive (David Lynch, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nGood question.\n\nWhy is it great?\nI debated about whether to include this or the longer, stranger Lynch film Inland Empire. Neither are films you can shake out of your mind but ultimately the nod goes to Mulholland Drive. It’s hard to say how the original plan for a TV show would have gone. Instead Lynch salvaged the stillborn pilot to create an enduring work of art. A lot of movies are weird for the sake of being weird while having nothing of substance underneath (take the paper-thin Donnie Darko, maybe the most overrated movie of the decade) but here Lynch delivers something worth digging into and exploring. In the end it’s really quite a simple story, but half the fun is piecing it all together. The other half is watching it - the scene of the opera singer dropping dead during Roy Orbison’s song Crying, thus revealing everything as an illusion, is a contender for greatest scene of the decade.\n\n\n12) Lost in Translation (Sofia Coppola, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nBill Murray and Scarlett Johansson star in a surprisingly non-creepy sort of romance story about two tourists in Japan trying to figure it all out.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThe oughts had a bit of an obsession with movies about people ‘finding’ themselves. Lost in Translation was the best of the bunch and set the bar for the Junos, Little Miss Sunshines and Garden States that followed. People tend to gush over, say, holocaust movies because of their heavy subject regardless of whether they’re well made. Yet here is a movie about two upper-class people fighting ennui and through some truly graceful filmmaking we genuinely relate to and care for them. In this case less is more: Long stretches of no dialogue? Instead take in the excellent soundtrack by Air. Having no plot to speak of? Yeah, well neither does real life. Coppola mixes just the right blend of wistfulness and humour so that by the ending fade out you feel truly satisfied.\n\n\n11) Battle Royale (Kinji Fukasaku, 2000)\n\nWhat is it?\nIn a futuristic dystopian Japan, a class of grade nine students is kidnapped, taken to an island, given weapons and told they must fight to the death until only one is left alive.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nUh, did you see the premise?

Plus it rejuvanated David Carradine''s career, so huge bonus points.\n\n\n7) Oldboy (Chan-wook Park, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nDuring a night of heavy drinking a man is mysteriously abducted, kept captive in a hotel-style room for 15 years without explanation and then released. He immediately goes on a quest for answers - and revenge.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThank god rumours of an American remake seem to have fizzled out. There is just no way to improve upon this breathtaking film. Like Battle Royale, Oldboy takes a wicked premise and doesn''t just live up to it but exceeds it. Chan-wook Park challenges you to keep up to his winding story that ventures miles beyond what mainstream western movies would dare to touch. This is revenge cinema at its finest. It''s so good that its also having one of the best fight scenes of the decade doesn''t even seem fair.\n\n\n6) Shaun of the Dead (Edgar Wright, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nA comedy? A horror movie? A zom-com? Who knows?\n\nWhy is it great?\nSure, it’s quick and funny enough to be on the list for yuks alone. But beyond that, Shaun is actually quite groundbreaking. How many movies, if any, have managed to so finely walk a line between two disparate genres? A hilarious toss up of zombie films while at the same time being a zombie film, Shaun of the Dead is the ultimate case of having your brains and eating them too.\n\n\n5) No Country for Old Men (The Coen brothers, 2007)\n\nWhat is it?\nThe best thriller of the decade.\n\nWhy is it great?\nSuck it, Stephen Spielberg. Joel and Ethan Coen show that they are the masters of cat-and-mouse thrill ride filmmaking. Everyone brings their A game to this one. You can''t ask for better technical camerawork and editing. Its pacing is unconventional but works to a tee. The cast is excellent but the show is stolen by Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh. With the Joker, Chigurh is one two characters that elevated villainhood to new hights. And of course the star behind the screen is Cormac McCArthy, whose faithfully adapted novel this all stems from.\n\n\n4) Zodiac (David Fincher, 2007)\n\nWhat is it?\nA genre-breaking film about the real life hunt to track down the Zodiac Killer.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nCould this be the best serial killer movie ever? I guess it’s not a fair question. While most focus on the mind of the killer (take Fincher’s own Se7en), this movie is about the people hunting him. More truly, it’s about obsession. Fincher puts on an absolute clinic of filmmaking. He juggles an incredible cast of characters (especially Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr.) and a complex, weaving plot that spans decades of dead ends and false starts, yet the movie never stops being gripping. It’s a story that shouldn’t work but Fincher inverts the focus and makes this all about that wing of human nature that refuses – or isn’t able – to let things go. People who derided this film as ''slow'' need to go back and see all that''s going as they''re missing exquisite filmmaking.\n\n\n3) The Barbarian Invasions (Denys Arcand, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nA Quebecois professor is diagnosed with cancer and admitted to hospital. As the end of his life nears, his family and friends gather together to see him off.\n\nWhy is it great?\nAdmittedly, the premise makes this movie sound entirely depressing. It’s not. It’s filled with dark humour, off-colour jokes, womanizing and drug use. This makes the moments of poignancy and insight that much more powerful. Clever, debauched and somehow comforting, this is a personal fable about something we all try to do eventually - come to terms with death. This is also my favourite Canadian film, period.\n', 14398);

(6, 1, '2011-02-12 19:30:09', 'What is it?\nDaniel Day-Lewis drinks other people’s milkshakes.\n\nWhy is it great?\nTo be honest, I’ve never found the character study of Daniel Plainview fully satisfying. We learn so much about how he is but virtually nothing about why. From his initial hatred of humanity to his final descent into loner hell, we’re never given an understanding as to what’s behind it all, which I think limits the character’s impact. Still, when the movie works it really works. When you’ve got one of the best directors alive working with one of the best actors alive in an early American oil epic it’s almost hard for it not to be great. Anderson’s beautiful, patient shots and the brilliant Plainview vs. Eli Sunday scenes are going to be just as riveting 50 years from now as they are today.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Super Troopers (Jay Chandrasekhar, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nA group of highway patrol officers get up to some shenanigans.\n\nWhy is it great?\nA lot of people seem to have Anchorman as one of their top movies, and for a while I was thinking of including it. Then my friend Alex shaved his beard into a moustache and I made a crack about moustache rides. Suddenly it hit me – Super Troopers is one of the best films of the decade. It has moments like its brilliant opening that can go toe-to-toe with Anchorman’s best scenes and it did a better job of not slipping into lazy, sit-comy writing. It’s smarter than Harold and Kumar, more consistent than Pineapple Express and more distinct than the pack of Judd Apatow flicks that filled the OOs. Quite simply, it’s the best stoner comedy of the decade.\n\n\n\\item Spirited Away (Hayao Miyazaki, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nA little girl stumbles into a ghost world after her parents are transformed into pigs. A modern-day Alice in Wonderland follows.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThis was an enviable decade to be a kid, as many children’s movies stopped relying on clichés and Phil Collins soundtracks and started treating their audiences with respect. But the one that impressed me the most wasn’t made by Pixar. Containing more visual ideas than 10 Disney movies combined along with a universal story about childhood, Spirited Away is the best animated film of the decade.\n\n\n\\item The Dark Knight (Christopher Nolan, 2008)\n\nWhat is it?\nNana nana nana nana nana nana nana nana… Batman.\n\nWhy is it great?\nI almost went with Christopher Nolan’s excellent rival magicians movie The Prestige instead, but ultimately I’ve got to hand it to The Dark Knight. Sure the whole x-ray vision stuff was goofy and there were some problems with the plot, but it deserves a spot for a few reasons. \\item It marked the growing up of super hero movies. In his flick, Spiderman had to choose between saving Mary Jane or a trolley full of people. He pulled some web bullshit and voila, everyone’s fine. Batman was given the same choice and a main character died. \\item Hack movies like Babel get fawned over for insipid themes like “not communicating is bad.” The Dark Knight deals with dark thematic issues most movies never touch, like the West’s responsibility for terrorism, deceiving the masses for their own good, love not saving anyone and the impossibility of living up to heroic expectations. \\item Incredibly memorable moments, like the bank heist opening. \\item Heath Ledger''s The Joker. Not just one of the two greatest villains of the decade, he''s one of the best all-time movie bad guys.\n\n\n\\item Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Michel Gondry, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nA love story told backwards as it’s forgotten.\n\nWhy is it great?\nBlah blah blah, Charlie Kaufman, blah blah, Michel Gondry, blah blah. By now everyone knows the praise for the script, visuals, and performances of this movie so I won’t rehash it here. Instead I’ll just say one thing I really respect about Eternal Sunshine is it resisted the urge to romanticize. Instead of waiting for the couple to figure out they’re obviously meant to be together, Eternal Sunshine gives us characters that probably aren’t right for each other and may well be doomed to repeat their mistakes. It’s this heavy dose of reality as much as the script and visuals that made this such a fresh viewing experience. And damn it, we’re all still rooting for Joel and Clementine.\n\n\n\\item 28 Days Later (Danny Boyle, 2002)\n\nWhat is it?\nA brilliantly stylized reinvention of the zombie genre from one of film''s most versatile directors.\n\nWhy is great?\nThis is the second most important zombie movie of all time (after Night of the Living Dead, obviously). Where Romero invented the genre as we know it, Boyle reinvented it for the 21st century. But there’s so much more than just the “fast zombies” that makes this movie great. Just watch the beginning and by the haunting scene of Cilian Murphy wandering around an abandoned London you know you’ve got a classic. And yes, 28 Days Later does count as a zombie movie.\n\n\n\\item Children of Men (Alfonso Cuaron, 2006)\n\nWhat is it?\nClive Own wanders the streets of a ragged, dying Britain. Children inexplicably stopped being born years ago, the youngest man in the world was just killed in a bar fight, xenophobia has manifested into a militaristic dictatorship and – oh shit, is that chick pregnant?\n\nWhy s it on the list?\nMan, these ten years were pretty thin on great sci fi movies. The 90s finished off on a high with Dark City and The Matrix then this decade tries to carry the torch with god-awful Matrix sequels and Star Wars prequels. The much championed Minority Report and Stark Trek were too shiny and pretty to be considered classics in my mind. Great sci fi should have some grit. Luckily we got quality mind-benders (Primer), space westerns (Serenity) and of course Children of Men, a story that encapsulates despair as well as any I’ve seen. Intriguing plot and strong acting aside, it’s the incredible cinematography that elevates this film to greatness. The stunning, single-shot car heist and city under siege scenes rank among the best of this generation.\n\n(Note: I’d probably have included Serenity on this list of not for that in my mind it’s inherently linked into the TV show Firefly.)\n\n\n\\item Mulholland Drive (David Lynch, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nGood question.\n\nWhy is it great?\nI debated about whether to include this or the longer, stranger Lynch film Inland Empire. Neither are films you can shake out of your mind but ultimately the nod goes to Mulholland Drive. It’s hard to say how the original plan for a TV show would have gone. Instead Lynch salvaged the stillborn pilot to create an enduring work of art. A lot of movies are weird for the sake of being weird while having nothing of substance underneath (take the paper-thin Donnie Darko, maybe the most overrated movie of the decade) but here Lynch delivers something worth digging into and exploring. In the end it’s really quite a simple story, but half the fun is piecing it all together. The other half is watching it - the scene of the opera singer dropping dead during Roy Orbison’s song Crying, thus revealing everything as an illusion, is a contender for greatest scene of the decade.\n\n\n\\item Lost in Translation (Sofia Coppola, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nBill Murray and Scarlett Johansson star in a surprisingly non-creepy sort of romance story about two tourists in Japan trying to figure it all out.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThe oughts had a bit of an obsession with movies about people ‘finding’ themselves. Lost in Translation was the best of the bunch and set the bar for the Junos, Little Miss Sunshines and Garden States that followed. People tend to gush over, say, holocaust movies because of their heavy subject regardless of whether they’re well made. Yet here is a movie about two upper-class people fighting ennui and through some truly graceful filmmaking we genuinely relate to and care for them. In this case less is more: Long stretches of no dialogue? Instead take in the excellent soundtrack by Air. Having no plot to speak of? Yeah, well neither does real life. Coppola mixes just the right blend of wistfulness and humour so that by the ending fade out you feel truly satisfied.\n\n\n\\item Battle Royale (Kinji Fukasaku, 2000)\n\nWhat is it?\nIn a futuristic dystopian Japan, a class of grade nine students is kidnapped, taken to an island, given weapons and told they must fight to the death until only one is left alive.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nUh, did you see the premise? Usually something that sounds that batshit awesome turns out to be a heap of disappointment. Not this time. This is one movie that knows how to follow through. I sill rank the first time I saw Battle Royale in high school as one of the most mind-blowing cinema experiences of my life.\n\n\n\\item Before Sunset (Richard Linklater, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nJulie Delpy and Ethan Hawke reunite 10 years after a one-night romantic tryst.\n\nWhy is it great?\n1995’s Before Sunrise was a charming film about two young people meeting randomly for one passionate night in Europe. Making a follow-up to its excellent ending – will they or won’t they fulfill their promise to meet one year later? – seemed like a terrible idea. Instead, this sequel bests its predecessor in every way. Delpy and Hawke still have some of the best on-screen chemistry ever seen, but 10 years later life has gotten complicated and their discussions have more weight. Instead of a young fairytale romance, here are two adults trying to recreate a fairytale romance. The beauty is in watching them pull it off. Linklater’s direction couldn’t be better – for a film that is basically one long string of dialogue it’s the sparse use of silence that has the most impact.\n\n\n\\item Memento (Christopher Nolan, 2000)\n\nWhat is it?\nThe story of a man with no short-term memory hunting his wife’s killer. Oh, and the movie runs backwards.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nI feel a pretty deep connection to this movie. At the time of its release it was my favourite film and in many ways it sparked my love of movies. It’s not the only film to do the backwards chronology thing (2002’s Irreversible, which I painfully couldn’t fit on this list, is a notable example) but it uses it brilliantly. What could have been a gimmick becomes an incredibly fresh way to tell a dark, unforgettable story that is still captivating today. This is raw movie-making gold.\n\n\n\\item Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2 (Quentin Tarantino, 2003/2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nTarantino, master of the literal title, delivers a loving homage to samurai movies.\n\nWhy is it great?\nFirst of all, it''s one big story so I''m throwing the two movies together. What''s striking about Kill Bill is that so much of it is made up of recycled parts. By assembling a mountain of shots and moments and molding them into one Power Rangersesque super movie, Tarantino has surpassed his source material. Only in Pulp Fiction has Tarantino brought style and substance together in such a dynamite package. Plus it rejuvanated David Carradine''s career, so huge bonus points.\n\n\n\\item Oldboy (Chan-wook Park, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nDuring a night of heavy drinking a man is mysteriously abducted, kept captive in a hotel-style room for 15 years without explanation and then released.

Fincher puts on an absolute clinic of filmmaking. He juggles an incredible cast of characters (especially Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr.) and a complex, weaving plot that spans decades of dead ends and false starts, yet the movie never stops being gripping. It’s a story that shouldn’t work but Fincher inverts the focus and makes this all about that wing of human nature that refuses – or isn’t able – to let things go. People who derided this film as ''slow'' need to go back and see all that''s going as they''re missing exquisite filmmaking.\n\n\n\\item \\textbf{The Barbarian Invasions (Denys Arcand, 2003)}\n\nWhat is it?\nA Quebecois professor is diagnosed with cancer and admitted to hospital.

(8, 1, '2011-02-12 19:33:08', 'What is it?\nDaniel Day-Lewis drinks other people’s milkshakes.\n\nWhy is it great?\nTo be honest, I’ve never found the character study of Daniel Plainview fully satisfying. We learn so much about how he is but virtually nothing about why. From his initial hatred of humanity to his final descent into loner hell, we’re never given an understanding as to what’s behind it all, which I think limits the character’s impact. Still, when the movie works it really works. When you’ve got one of the best directors alive working with one of the best actors alive in an early American oil epic it’s almost hard for it not to be great. Anderson’s beautiful, patient shots and the brilliant Plainview vs. Eli Sunday scenes are going to be just as riveting 50 years from now as they are today.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Super Troopers (Jay Chandrasekhar, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nA group of highway patrol officers get up to some shenanigans.\n\nWhy is it great?\nA lot of people seem to have Anchorman as one of their top movies, and for a while I was thinking of including it. Then my friend Alex shaved his beard into a moustache and I made a crack about moustache rides. Suddenly it hit me – Super Troopers is one of the best films of the decade. It has moments like its brilliant opening that can go toe-to-toe with Anchorman’s best scenes and it did a better job of not slipping into lazy, sit-comy writing. It’s smarter than Harold and Kumar, more consistent than Pineapple Express and more distinct than the pack of Judd Apatow flicks that filled the OOs. Quite simply, it’s the best stoner comedy of the decade.\n\n\n\\item Spirited Away (Hayao Miyazaki, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nA little girl stumbles into a ghost world after her parents are transformed into pigs. A modern-day Alice in Wonderland follows.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThis was an enviable decade to be a kid, as many children’s movies stopped relying on clichés and Phil Collins soundtracks and started treating their audiences with respect. But the one that impressed me the most wasn’t made by Pixar. Containing more visual ideas than 10 Disney movies combined along with a universal story about childhood, Spirited Away is the best animated film of the decade.\n\n\n\\item The Dark Knight (Christopher Nolan, 2008)\n\nWhat is it?\nNana nana nana nana nana nana nana nana… Batman.\n\nWhy is it great?\nI almost went with Christopher Nolan’s excellent rival magicians movie The Prestige instead, but ultimately I’ve got to hand it to The Dark Knight. Sure the whole x-ray vision stuff was goofy and there were some problems with the plot, but it deserves a spot for a few reasons.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item It marked the growing up of super hero movies. In his flick, Spiderman had to choose between saving Mary Jane or a trolley full of people. He pulled some web bullshit and voila, everyone’s fine. Batman was given the same choice and a main character died.\n\\item Hack movies like Babel get fawned over for insipid themes like "not communicating is bad." The Dark Knight deals with dark thematic issues most movies never touch, like the West’s responsibility for terrorism, deceiving the masses for their own good, love not saving anyone and the impossibility of living up to heroic expectations.\n\\item Incredibly memorable moments, like the bank heist opening.\n\\item Heath Ledger''s The Joker. Not just one of the two greatest villains of the decade, he''s one of the best all-time movie bad guys.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\item Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Michel Gondry, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nA love story told backwards as it’s forgotten.\n\nWhy is it great?\nBlah blah blah, Charlie Kaufman, blah blah, Michel Gondry, blah blah. By now everyone knows the praise for the script, visuals, and performances of this movie so I won’t rehash it here. Instead I’ll just say one thing I really respect about Eternal Sunshine is it resisted the urge to romanticize. Instead of waiting for the couple to figure out they’re obviously meant to be together, Eternal Sunshine gives us characters that probably aren’t right for each other and may well be doomed to repeat their mistakes. It’s this heavy dose of reality as much as the script and visuals that made this such a fresh viewing experience. And damn it, we’re all still rooting for Joel and Clementine.\n\n\n\\item 28 Days Later (Danny Boyle, 2002)\n\nWhat is it?\nA brilliantly stylized reinvention of the zombie genre from one of film''s most versatile directors.\n\nWhy is great?\nThis is the second most important zombie movie of all time (after Night of the Living Dead, obviously). Where Romero invented the genre as we know it, Boyle reinvented it for the 21st century. But there’s so much more than just the “fast zombies” that makes this movie great. Just watch the beginning and by the haunting scene of Cilian Murphy wandering around an abandoned London you know you’ve got a classic. And yes, 28 Days Later does count as a zombie movie.\n\n\n\\item Children of Men (Alfonso Cuaron, 2006)\n\nWhat is it?\nClive Own wanders the streets of a ragged, dying Britain. Children inexplicably stopped being born years ago, the youngest man in the world was just killed in a bar fight, xenophobia has manifested into a militaristic dictatorship and – oh shit, is that chick pregnant?\n\nWhy s it on the list?\nMan, these ten years were pretty thin on great sci fi movies. The 90s finished off on a high with Dark City and The Matrix then this decade tries to carry the torch with god-awful Matrix sequels and Star Wars prequels. The much championed Minority Report and Stark Trek were too shiny and pretty to be considered classics in my mind. Great sci fi should have some grit. Luckily we got quality mind-benders (Primer), space westerns (Serenity) and of course Children of Men, a story that encapsulates despair as well as any I’ve seen. Intriguing plot and strong acting aside, it’s the incredible cinematography that elevates this film to greatness. The stunning, single-shot car heist and city under siege scenes rank among the best of this generation.\n\n(Note: I’d probably have included Serenity on this list of not for that in my mind it’s inherently linked into the TV show Firefly.)\n\n\n\\item Mulholland Drive (David Lynch, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nGood question.\n\nWhy is it great?\nI debated about whether to include this or the longer, stranger Lynch film Inland Empire. Neither are films you can shake out of your mind but ultimately the nod goes to Mulholland Drive. It’s hard to say how the original plan for a TV show would have gone. Instead Lynch salvaged the stillborn pilot to create an enduring work of art. A lot of movies are weird for the sake of being weird while having nothing of substance underneath (take the paper-thin Donnie Darko, maybe the most overrated movie of the decade) but here Lynch delivers something worth digging into and exploring. In the end it’s really quite a simple story, but half the fun is piecing it all together. The other half is watching it - the scene of the opera singer dropping dead during Roy Orbison’s song Crying, thus revealing everything as an illusion, is a contender for greatest scene of the decade.\n\n\n\\item Lost in Translation (Sofia Coppola, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nBill Murray and Scarlett Johansson star in a surprisingly non-creepy sort of romance story about two tourists in Japan trying to figure it all out.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThe oughts had a bit of an obsession with movies about people ‘finding’ themselves. Lost in Translation was the best of the bunch and set the bar for the Junos, Little Miss Sunshines and Garden States that followed. People tend to gush over, say, holocaust movies because of their heavy subject regardless of whether they’re well made. Yet here is a movie about two upper-class people fighting ennui and through some truly graceful filmmaking we genuinely relate to and care for them. In this case less is more: Long stretches of no dialogue? Instead take in the excellent soundtrack by Air. Having no plot to speak of? Yeah, well neither does real life. Coppola mixes just the right blend of wistfulness and humour so that by the ending fade out you feel truly satisfied.\n\n\n\\item Battle Royale (Kinji Fukasaku, 2000)\n\nWhat is it?\nIn a futuristic dystopian Japan, a class of grade nine students is kidnapped, taken to an island, given weapons and told they must fight to the death until only one is left alive.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nUh, did you see the premise? Usually something that sounds that batshit awesome turns out to be a heap of disappointment. Not this time. This is one movie that knows how to follow through. I sill rank the first time I saw Battle Royale in high school as one of the most mind-blowing cinema experiences of my life.\n\n\n\\item Before Sunset (Richard Linklater, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nJulie Delpy and Ethan Hawke reunite 10 years after a one-night romantic tryst.\n\nWhy is it great?\n1995’s Before Sunrise was a charming film about two young people meeting randomly for one passionate night in Europe. Making a follow-up to its excellent ending – will they or won’t they fulfill their promise to meet one year later? – seemed like a terrible idea. Instead, this sequel bests its predecessor in every way. Delpy and Hawke still have some of the best on-screen chemistry ever seen, but 10 years later life has gotten complicated and their discussions have more weight. Instead of a young fairytale romance, here are two adults trying to recreate a fairytale romance. The beauty is in watching them pull it off. Linklater’s direction couldn’t be better – for a film that is basically one long string of dialogue it’s the sparse use of silence that has the most impact.\n\n\n\\item Memento (Christopher Nolan, 2000)\n\nWhat is it?\nThe story of a man with no short-term memory hunting his wife’s killer. Oh, and the movie runs backwards.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nI feel a pretty deep connection to this movie. At the time of its release it was my favourite film and in many ways it sparked my love of movies. It’s not the only film to do the backwards chronology thing (2002’s Irreversible, which I painfully couldn’t fit on this list, is a notable example) but it uses it brilliantly. What could have been a gimmick becomes an incredibly fresh way to tell a dark, unforgettable story that is still captivating today. This is raw movie-making gold.\n\n\n\\item Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2 (Quentin Tarantino, 2003/2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nTarantino, master of the literal title, delivers a loving homage to samurai movies.\n\nWhy is it great?\nFirst of all, it''s one big story so I''m throwing the two movies together. What''s striking about Kill Bill is that so much of it is made up of recycled parts. By assembling a mountain of shots and moments and molding them into one Power Rangersesque super movie, Tarantino has surpassed his source material. Only in Pulp Fiction has Tarantino brought style and substance together in such a dynamite package. Plus it rejuvanated David Carradine''s career, so huge bonus points.\n\n\n\\item Oldboy (Chan-wook Park, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nDuring a night of heavy drinking a man is mysteriously abducted, kept captive in a hotel-style room for 15 years without explanation and then released. He immediately goes on a quest for answers - and revenge.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThank god rumours of an American remake seem to have fizzled out. There is just no way to improve upon this breathtaking film. Like Battle Royale, Oldboy takes a wicked premise and doesn''t just live up to it but exceeds it. Chan-wook Park challenges you to keep up to his winding story that ventures miles beyond what mainstream western movies would dare to touch. This is revenge cinema at its finest. It''s so good that its also having one of the best fight scenes of the decade doesn''t even seem fair.\n\n\n\\item Shaun of the Dead (Edgar Wright, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nA comedy? A horror movie? A zom-com? Who knows?\n\nWhy is it great?\nSure, it’s quick and funny enough to be on the list for yuks alone. But beyond that, Shaun is actually quite groundbreaking. How many movies, if any, have managed to so finely walk a line between two disparate genres? A hilarious toss up of zombie films while at the same time being a zombie film, Shaun of the Dead is the ultimate case of having your brains and eating them too.\n\n\n\\item No Country for Old Men (The Coen brothers, 2007)\n\nWhat is it?\nThe best thriller of the decade.\n\nWhy is it great?\nSuck it, Stephen Spielberg. Joel and Ethan Coen show that they are the masters of cat-and-mouse thrill ride filmmaking. Everyone brings their A game to this one. You can''t ask for better technical camerawork and editing. Its pacing is unconventional but works to a tee. The cast is excellent but the show is stolen by Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh. With the Joker, Chigurh is one two characters that elevated villainhood to new hights. And of course the star behind the screen is Cormac McCArthy, whose faithfully adapted novel this all stems from.\n\n\n\\item Zodiac (David Fincher, 2007)\n\nWhat is it?\nA genre-breaking film about the real life hunt to track down the Zodiac Killer.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nCould this be the best serial killer movie ever?

Anderson’s beautiful, patient shots and the brilliant Plainview vs. Eli Sunday scenes are going to be just as riveting 50 years from now as they are today.\n\n\\includegraphics[align=center]{frise_14.jpg}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Super Troopers (Jay Chandrasekhar, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nA group of highway patrol officers get up to some shenanigans.\n\nWhy is it great?\nA lot of people seem to have Anchorman as one of their top movies, and for a while I was thinking of including it. Then my friend Alex shaved his beard into a moustache and I made a crack about moustache rides. Suddenly it hit me – Super Troopers is one of the best films of the decade. It has moments like its brilliant opening that can go toe-to-toe with Anchorman’s best scenes and it did a better job of not slipping into lazy, sit-comy writing. It’s smarter than Harold and Kumar, more consistent than Pineapple Express and more distinct than the pack of Judd Apatow flicks that filled the OOs. Quite simply, it’s the best stoner comedy of the decade.\n\n\n\\item Spirited Away (Hayao Miyazaki, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nA little girl stumbles into a ghost world after her parents are transformed into pigs. A modern-day Alice in Wonderland follows.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThis was an enviable decade to be a kid, as many children’s movies stopped relying on clichés and Phil Collins soundtracks and started treating their audiences with respect. But the one that impressed me the most wasn’t made by Pixar. Containing more visual ideas than 10 Disney movies combined along with a universal story about childhood, Spirited Away is the best animated film of the decade.\n\n\n\\item The Dark Knight (Christopher Nolan, 2008)\n\nWhat is it?\nNana nana nana nana nana nana nana nana… Batman.\n\nWhy is it great?\nI almost went with Christopher Nolan’s excellent rival magicians movie The Prestige instead, but ultimately I’ve got to hand it to The Dark Knight. Sure the whole x-ray vision stuff was goofy and there were some problems with the plot, but it deserves a spot for a few reasons.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item It marked the growing up of super hero movies. In his flick, Spiderman had to choose between saving Mary Jane or a trolley full of people. He pulled some web bullshit and voila, everyone’s fine. Batman was given the same choice and a main character died.\n\\item Hack movies like Babel get fawned over for insipid themes like "not communicating is bad." The Dark Knight deals with dark thematic issues most movies never touch, like the West’s responsibility for terrorism, deceiving the masses for their own good, love not saving anyone and the impossibility of living up to heroic expectations.\n\\item Incredibly memorable moments, like the bank heist opening.\n\\item Heath Ledger''s The Joker. Not just one of the two greatest villains of the decade, he''s one of the best all-time movie bad guys.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\item Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Michel Gondry, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nA love story told backwards as it’s forgotten.\n\nWhy is it great?\nBlah blah blah, Charlie Kaufman, blah blah, Michel Gondry, blah blah. By now everyone knows the praise for the script, visuals, and performances of this movie so I won’t rehash it here. Instead I’ll just say one thing I really respect about Eternal Sunshine is it resisted the urge to romanticize. Instead of waiting for the couple to figure out they’re obviously meant to be together, Eternal Sunshine gives us characters that probably aren’t right for each other and may well be doomed to repeat their mistakes. It’s this heavy dose of reality as much as the script and visuals that made this such a fresh viewing experience. And damn it, we’re all still rooting for Joel and Clementine.\n\n\n\\item 28 Days Later (Danny Boyle, 2002)\n\nWhat is it?\nA brilliantly stylized reinvention of the zombie genre from one of film''s most versatile directors.\n\nWhy is great?\nThis is the second most important zombie movie of all time (after Night of the Living Dead, obviously). Where Romero invented the genre as we know it, Boyle reinvented it for the 21st century. But there’s so much more than just the “fast zombies” that makes this movie great. Just watch the beginning and by the haunting scene of Cilian Murphy wandering around an abandoned London you know you’ve got a classic. And yes, 28 Days Later does count as a zombie movie.\n\n\n\\item Children of Men (Alfonso Cuaron, 2006)\n\nWhat is it?\nClive Own wanders the streets of a ragged, dying Britain. Children inexplicably stopped being born years ago, the youngest man in the world was just killed in a bar fight, xenophobia has manifested into a militaristic dictatorship and – oh shit, is that chick pregnant?\n\nWhy s it on the list?\nMan, these ten years were pretty thin on great sci fi movies. The 90s finished off on a high with Dark City and The Matrix then this decade tries to carry the torch with god-awful Matrix sequels and Star Wars prequels. The much championed Minority Report and Stark Trek were too shiny and pretty to be considered classics in my mind. Great sci fi should have some grit. Luckily we got quality mind-benders (Primer), space westerns (Serenity) and of course Children of Men, a story that encapsulates despair as well as any I’ve seen. Intriguing plot and strong acting aside, it’s the incredible cinematography that elevates this film to greatness. The stunning, single-shot car heist and city under siege scenes rank among the best of this generation.\n\n(Note: I’d probably have included Serenity on this list of not for that in my mind it’s inherently linked into the TV show Firefly.)\n\n\n\\item Mulholland Drive (David Lynch, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nGood question.\n\nWhy is it great?\nI debated about whether to include this or the longer, stranger Lynch film Inland Empire. Neither are films you can shake out of your mind but ultimately the nod goes to Mulholland Drive. It’s hard to say how the original plan for a TV show would have gone. Instead Lynch salvaged the stillborn pilot to create an enduring work of art. A lot of movies are weird for the sake of being weird while having nothing of substance underneath (take the paper-thin Donnie Darko, maybe the most overrated movie of the decade) but here Lynch delivers something worth digging into and exploring. In the end it’s really quite a simple story, but half the fun is piecing it all together. The other half is watching it - the scene of the opera singer dropping dead during Roy Orbison’s song Crying, thus revealing everything as an illusion, is a contender for greatest scene of the decade.\n\n\n\\item Lost in Translation (Sofia Coppola, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nBill Murray and Scarlett Johansson star in a surprisingly non-creepy sort of romance story about two tourists in Japan trying to figure it all out.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThe oughts had a bit of an obsession with movies about people ‘finding’ themselves. Lost in Translation was the best of the bunch and set the bar for the Junos, Little Miss Sunshines and Garden States that followed. People tend to gush over, say, holocaust movies because of their heavy subject regardless of whether they’re well made. Yet here is a movie about two upper-class people fighting ennui and through some truly graceful filmmaking we genuinely relate to and care for them. In this case less is more: Long stretches of no dialogue? Instead take in the excellent soundtrack by Air. Having no plot to speak of? Yeah, well neither does real life. Coppola mixes just the right blend of wistfulness and humour so that by the ending fade out you feel truly satisfied.\n\n\n\\item Battle Royale (Kinji Fukasaku, 2000)\n\nWhat is it?\nIn a futuristic dystopian Japan, a class of grade nine students is kidnapped, taken to an island, given weapons and told they must fight to the death until only one is left alive.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nUh, did you see the premise? Usually something that sounds that batshit awesome turns out to be a heap of disappointment. Not this time. This is one movie that knows how to follow through. I sill rank the first time I saw Battle Royale in high school as one of the most mind-blowing cinema experiences of my life.\n\n\n\\item Before Sunset (Richard Linklater, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nJulie Delpy and Ethan Hawke reunite 10 years after a one-night romantic tryst.\n\nWhy is it great?\n1995’s Before Sunrise was a charming film about two young people meeting randomly for one passionate night in Europe. Making a follow-up to its excellent ending – will they or won’t they fulfill their promise to meet one year later? – seemed like a terrible idea. Instead, this sequel bests its predecessor in every way. Delpy and Hawke still have some of the best on-screen chemistry ever seen, but 10 years later life has gotten complicated and their discussions have more weight. Instead of a young fairytale romance, here are two adults trying to recreate a fairytale romance. The beauty is in watching them pull it off. Linklater’s direction couldn’t be better – for a film that is basically one long string of dialogue it’s the sparse use of silence that has the most impact.\n\n\n\\item Memento (Christopher Nolan, 2000)\n\nWhat is it?\nThe story of a man with no short-term memory hunting his wife’s killer. Oh, and the movie runs backwards.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nI feel a pretty deep connection to this movie. At the time of its release it was my favourite film and in many ways it sparked my love of movies. It’s not the only film to do the backwards chronology thing (2002’s Irreversible, which I painfully couldn’t fit on this list, is a notable example) but it uses it brilliantly. What could have been a gimmick becomes an incredibly fresh way to tell a dark, unforgettable story that is still captivating today. This is raw movie-making gold.\n\n\n\\item Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2 (Quentin Tarantino, 2003/2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nTarantino, master of the literal title, delivers a loving homage to samurai movies.\n\nWhy is it great?\nFirst of all, it''s one big story so I''m throwing the two movies together. What''s striking about Kill Bill is that so much of it is made up of recycled parts. By assembling a mountain of shots and moments and molding them into one Power Rangersesque super movie, Tarantino has surpassed his source material. Only in Pulp Fiction has Tarantino brought style and substance together in such a dynamite package. Plus it rejuvanated David Carradine''s career, so huge bonus points.\n\n\n\\item Oldboy (Chan-wook Park, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nDuring a night of heavy drinking a man is mysteriously abducted, kept captive in a hotel-style room for 15 years without explanation and then released. He immediately goes on a quest for answers - and revenge.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThank god rumours of an American remake seem to have fizzled out. There is just no way to improve upon this breathtaking film. Like Battle Royale, Oldboy takes a wicked premise and doesn''t just live up to it but exceeds it. Chan-wook Park challenges you to keep up to his winding story that ventures miles beyond what mainstream western movies would dare to touch. This is revenge cinema at its finest. It''s so good that its also having one of the best fight scenes of the decade doesn''t even seem fair.\n\n\n\\item Shaun of the Dead (Edgar Wright, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nA comedy? A horror movie? A zom-com? Who knows?\n\nWhy is it great?\nSure, it’s quick and funny enough to be on the list for yuks alone. But beyond that, Shaun is actually quite groundbreaking. How many movies, if any, have managed to so finely walk a line between two disparate genres? A hilarious toss up of zombie films while at the same time being a zombie film, Shaun of the Dead is the ultimate case of having your brains and eating them too.\n\n\n\\item No Country for Old Men (The Coen brothers, 2007)\n\nWhat is it?\nThe best thriller of the decade.\n\nWhy is it great?\nSuck it, Stephen Spielberg. Joel and Ethan Coen show that they are the masters of cat-and-mouse thrill ride filmmaking. Everyone brings their A game to this one. You can''t ask for better technical camerawork and editing. Its pacing is unconventional but works to a tee. The cast is excellent but the show is stolen by Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh. With the Joker, Chigurh is one two characters that elevated villainhood to new hights. And of course the star behind the screen is Cormac McCArthy, whose faithfully adapted novel this all stems from.\n\n\n\\item Zodiac (David Fincher, 2007)\n\nWhat is it?\nA genre-breaking film about the real life hunt to track down the Zodiac Killer.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nCould this be the best serial killer movie ever? I guess it’s not a fair question. While most focus on the mind of the killer (take Fincher’s own Se7en), this movie is about the people hunting him. More truly, it’s about obsession. Fincher puts on an absolute clinic of filmmaking. He juggles an incredible cast of characters (especially Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr.) and a complex, weaving plot that spans decades of dead ends and false starts, yet the movie never stops being gripping. It’s a story that shouldn’t work but Fincher inverts the focus and makes this all about that wing of human nature that refuses – or isn’t able – to let things go. People who derided this film as ''slow'' need to go back and see all that''s going as they''re missing exquisite filmmaking.\n\n\n\\item The Barbarian Invasions (Denys Arcand, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nA Quebecois professor is diagnosed with cancer and admitted to hospital. As the end of his life nears, his family and friends gather together to see him off.\n\nWhy is it great?\nAdmittedly, the premise makes this movie sound entirely depressing. It’s not. It’s filled with dark humour, off-colour jokes, womanizing and drug use. This makes the moments of poignancy and insight that much more powerful. Clever, debauched and somehow comforting, this is a personal fable about something we all try to do eventually - come to terms with death. This is also my favourite Canadian film, period.\n\\end{enumerate}', 14558),
(11, 1, '2011-02-12 19:35:01', 'What is it?\nDaniel Day-Lewis drinks other people’s milkshakes.\n\nWhy is it great?\nTo be honest, I’ve never found the character study of Daniel Plainview fully satisfying. We learn so much about how he is but virtually nothing about why. From his initial hatred of humanity to his final descent into loner hell, we’re never given an understanding as to what’s behind it all, which I think limits the character’s impact.

The Dark Knight deals with dark thematic issues most movies never touch, like the West’s responsibility for terrorism, deceiving the masses for their own good, love not saving anyone and the impossibility of living up to heroic expectations.\n\\item Incredibly memorable moments, like the bank heist opening.\n\\item Heath Ledger''s The Joker. Not just one of the two greatest villains of the decade, he''s one of the best all-time movie bad guys.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\item Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Michel Gondry, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nA love story told backwards as it’s forgotten.\n\nWhy is it great?\nBlah blah blah, Charlie Kaufman, blah blah, Michel Gondry, blah blah. By now everyone knows the praise for the script, visuals, and performances of this movie so I won’t rehash it here. Instead I’ll just say one thing I really respect about Eternal Sunshine is it resisted the urge to romanticize. Instead of waiting for the couple to figure out they’re obviously meant to be together, Eternal Sunshine gives us characters that probably aren’t right for each other and may well be doomed to repeat their mistakes. It’s this heavy dose of reality as much as the script and visuals that made this such a fresh viewing experience. And damn it, we’re all still rooting for Joel and Clementine.\n\n\n\\item 28 Days Later (Danny Boyle, 2002)\n\nWhat is it?\nA brilliantly stylized reinvention of the zombie genre from one of film''s most versatile directors.\n\nWhy is great?\nThis is the second most important zombie movie of all time (after Night of the Living Dead, obviously). Where Romero invented the genre as we know it, Boyle reinvented it for the 21st century. But there’s so much more than just the “fast zombies” that makes this movie great. Just watch the beginning and by the haunting scene of Cilian Murphy wandering around an abandoned London you know you’ve got a classic. And yes, 28 Days Later does count as a zombie movie.\n\n\n\\item Children of Men (Alfonso Cuaron, 2006)\n\nWhat is it?\nClive Own wanders the streets of a ragged, dying Britain. Children inexplicably stopped being born years ago, the youngest man in the world was just killed in a bar fight, xenophobia has manifested into a militaristic dictatorship and – oh shit, is that chick pregnant?\n\nWhy s it on the list?\nMan, these ten years were pretty thin on great sci fi movies. The 90s finished off on a high with Dark City and The Matrix then this decade tries to carry the torch with god-awful Matrix sequels and Star Wars prequels. The much championed Minority Report and Stark Trek were too shiny and pretty to be considered classics in my mind. Great sci fi should have some grit. Luckily we got quality mind-benders (Primer), space westerns (Serenity) and of course Children of Men, a story that encapsulates despair as well as any I’ve seen. Intriguing plot and strong acting aside, it’s the incredible cinematography that elevates this film to greatness. The stunning, single-shot car heist and city under siege scenes rank among the best of this generation.\n\n(Note: I’d probably have included Serenity on this list of not for that in my mind it’s inherently linked into the TV show Firefly.)\n\n\n\\item Mulholland Drive (David Lynch, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nGood question.\n\nWhy is it great?\nI debated about whether to include this or the longer, stranger Lynch film Inland Empire. Neither are films you can shake out of your mind but ultimately the nod goes to Mulholland Drive. It’s hard to say how the original plan for a TV show would have gone. Instead Lynch salvaged the stillborn pilot to create an enduring work of art. A lot of movies are weird for the sake of being weird while having nothing of substance underneath (take the paper-thin Donnie Darko, maybe the most overrated movie of the decade) but here Lynch delivers something worth digging into and exploring. In the end it’s really quite a simple story, but half the fun is piecing it all together. The other half is watching it - the scene of the opera singer dropping dead during Roy Orbison’s song Crying, thus revealing everything as an illusion, is a contender for greatest scene of the decade.\n\n\n\\item Lost in Translation (Sofia Coppola, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nBill Murray and Scarlett Johansson star in a surprisingly non-creepy sort of romance story about two tourists in Japan trying to figure it all out.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThe oughts had a bit of an obsession with movies about people ‘finding’ themselves. Lost in Translation was the best of the bunch and set the bar for the Junos, Little Miss Sunshines and Garden States that followed. People tend to gush over, say, holocaust movies because of their heavy subject regardless of whether they’re well made. Yet here is a movie about two upper-class people fighting ennui and through some truly graceful filmmaking we genuinely relate to and care for them. In this case less is more: Long stretches of no dialogue? Instead take in the excellent soundtrack by Air. Having no plot to speak of? Yeah, well neither does real life. Coppola mixes just the right blend of wistfulness and humour so that by the ending fade out you feel truly satisfied.\n\n\n\\item Battle Royale (Kinji Fukasaku, 2000)\n\nWhat is it?\nIn a futuristic dystopian Japan, a class of grade nine students is kidnapped, taken to an island, given weapons and told they must fight to the death until only one is left alive.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nUh, did you see the premise? Usually something that sounds that batshit awesome turns out to be a heap of disappointment. Not this time. This is one movie that knows how to follow through. I sill rank the first time I saw Battle Royale in high school as one of the most mind-blowing cinema experiences of my life.\n\n\n\\item Before Sunset (Richard Linklater, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nJulie Delpy and Ethan Hawke reunite 10 years after a one-night romantic tryst.\n\nWhy is it great?\n1995’s Before Sunrise was a charming film about two young people meeting randomly for one passionate night in Europe. Making a follow-up to its excellent ending – will they or won’t they fulfill their promise to meet one year later? – seemed like a terrible idea. Instead, this sequel bests its predecessor in every way. Delpy and Hawke still have some of the best on-screen chemistry ever seen, but 10 years later life has gotten complicated and their discussions have more weight. Instead of a young fairytale romance, here are two adults trying to recreate a fairytale romance. The beauty is in watching them pull it off. Linklater’s direction couldn’t be better – for a film that is basically one long string of dialogue it’s the sparse use of silence that has the most impact.\n\n\n\\item Memento (Christopher Nolan, 2000)\n\nWhat is it?\nThe story of a man with no short-term memory hunting his wife’s killer. Oh, and the movie runs backwards.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nI feel a pretty deep connection to this movie. At the time of its release it was my favourite film and in many ways it sparked my love of movies. It’s not the only film to do the backwards chronology thing (2002’s Irreversible, which I painfully couldn’t fit on this list, is a notable example) but it uses it brilliantly. What could have been a gimmick becomes an incredibly fresh way to tell a dark, unforgettable story that is still captivating today. This is raw movie-making gold.\n\n\n\\item Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2 (Quentin Tarantino, 2003/2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nTarantino, master of the literal title, delivers a loving homage to samurai movies.\n\nWhy is it great?\nFirst of all, it''s one big story so I''m throwing the two movies together. What''s striking about Kill Bill is that so much of it is made up of recycled parts. By assembling a mountain of shots and moments and molding them into one Power Rangersesque super movie, Tarantino has surpassed his source material. Only in Pulp Fiction has Tarantino brought style and substance together in such a dynamite package. Plus it rejuvanated David Carradine''s career, so huge bonus points.\n\n\n\\item Oldboy (Chan-wook Park, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nDuring a night of heavy drinking a man is mysteriously abducted, kept captive in a hotel-style room for 15 years without explanation and then released. He immediately goes on a quest for answers - and revenge.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThank god rumours of an American remake seem to have fizzled out. There is just no way to improve upon this breathtaking film. Like Battle Royale, Oldboy takes a wicked premise and doesn''t just live up to it but exceeds it. Chan-wook Park challenges you to keep up to his winding story that ventures miles beyond what mainstream western movies would dare to touch. This is revenge cinema at its finest. It''s so good that its also having one of the best fight scenes of the decade doesn''t even seem fair.\n\n\n\\item Shaun of the Dead (Edgar Wright, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nA comedy? A horror movie? A zom-com? Who knows?\n\nWhy is it great?\nSure, it’s quick and funny enough to be on the list for yuks alone. But beyond that, Shaun is actually quite groundbreaking. How many movies, if any, have managed to so finely walk a line between two disparate genres? A hilarious toss up of zombie films while at the same time being a zombie film, Shaun of the Dead is the ultimate case of having your brains and eating them too.\n\n\n\\item No Country for Old Men (The Coen brothers, 2007)\n\nWhat is it?\nThe best thriller of the decade.\n\nWhy is it great?\nSuck it, Stephen Spielberg. Joel and Ethan Coen show that they are the masters of cat-and-mouse thrill ride filmmaking. Everyone brings their A game to this one. You can''t ask for better technical camerawork and editing. Its pacing is unconventional but works to a tee. The cast is excellent but the show is stolen by Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh. With the Joker, Chigurh is one two characters that elevated villainhood to new hights. And of course the star behind the screen is Cormac McCArthy, whose faithfully adapted novel this all stems from.\n\n\n\\item Zodiac (David Fincher, 2007)\n\nWhat is it?\nA genre-breaking film about the real life hunt to track down the Zodiac Killer.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nCould this be the best serial killer movie ever? I guess it’s not a fair question. While most focus on the mind of the killer (take Fincher’s own Se7en), this movie is about the people hunting him. More truly, it’s about obsession. Fincher puts on an absolute clinic of filmmaking. He juggles an incredible cast of characters (especially Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr.) and a complex, weaving plot that spans decades of dead ends and false starts, yet the movie never stops being gripping. It’s a story that shouldn’t work but Fincher inverts the focus and makes this all about that wing of human nature that refuses – or isn’t able – to let things go. People who derided this film as ''slow'' need to go back and see all that''s going as they''re missing exquisite filmmaking.\n\n\n\\item The Barbarian Invasions (Denys Arcand, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nA Quebecois professor is diagnosed with cancer and admitted to hospital. As the end of his life nears, his family and friends gather together to see him off.\n\nWhy is it great?\nAdmittedly, the premise makes this movie sound entirely depressing. It’s not. It’s filled with dark humour, off-colour jokes, womanizing and drug use. This makes the moments of poignancy and insight that much more powerful. Clever, debauched and somehow comforting, this is a personal fable about something we all try to do eventually - come to terms with death. This is also my favourite Canadian film, period.\n\\end{enumerate}', 14564),
(13, 1, '2011-02-12 20:18:11', 'What is it?\nDaniel Day-Lewis drinks other people’s milkshakes.\n\nWhy is it great?\nTo be honest, I’ve never found the character study of Daniel Plainview fully satisfying. We learn so much about how he is but virtually nothing about why. From his initial hatred of humanity to his final descent into loner hell, we’re never given an understanding as to what’s behind it all, which I think limits the character’s impact. Still, when the movie works it really works. When you’ve got one of the best directors alive working with one of the best actors alive in an early American oil epic it’s almost hard for it not to be great. Anderson’s beautiful, patient shots and the brilliant Plainview vs. Eli Sunday scenes are going to be just as riveting 50 years from now as they are today.\n\n\\includegraphics[center]{frise_14.jpg}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Super Troopers (Jay Chandrasekhar, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nA group of highway patrol officers get up to some shenanigans.\n\nWhy is it great?\nA lot of people seem to have Anchorman as one of their top movies, and for a while I was thinking of including it. Then my friend Alex shaved his beard into a moustache and I made a crack about moustache rides. Suddenly it hit me – Super Troopers is one of the best films of the decade. It has moments like its brilliant opening that can go toe-to-toe with Anchorman’s best scenes and it did a better job of not slipping into lazy, sit-comy writing. It’s smarter than Harold and Kumar, more consistent than Pineapple Express and more distinct than the pack of Judd Apatow flicks that filled the OOs. Quite simply, it’s the best stoner comedy of the decade.\n\n\n\\item Spirited Away (Hayao Miyazaki, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nA little girl stumbles into a ghost world after her parents are transformed into pigs. A modern-day Alice in Wonderland follows.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThis was an enviable decade to be a kid, as many children’s movies stopped relying on clichés and Phil Collins soundtracks and started treating their audiences with respect. But the one that impressed me the most wasn’t made by Pixar. Containing more visual ideas than 10 Disney movies combined along with a universal story about childhood, Spirited Away is the best animated film of the decade.\n\n\n\\item The Dark Knight (Christopher Nolan, 2008)\n\nWhat is it?\nNana nana nana nana nana nana nana nana… Batman.\n\nWhy is it great?\nI almost went with Christopher Nolan’s excellent rival magicians movie The Prestige instead, but ultimately I’ve got to hand it to The Dark Knight.

The much championed Minority Report and Stark Trek were too shiny and pretty to be considered classics in my mind. Great sci fi should have some grit. Luckily we got quality mind-benders (Primer), space westerns (Serenity) and of course Children of Men, a story that encapsulates despair as well as any I’ve seen. Intriguing plot and strong acting aside, it’s the incredible cinematography that elevates this film to greatness. The stunning, single-shot car heist and city under siege scenes rank among the best of this generation.\n\n(Note: I’d probably have included Serenity on this list of not for that in my mind it’s inherently linked into the TV show Firefly.)\n\n\n\\item Mulholland Drive (David Lynch, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nGood question.\n\nWhy is it great?\nI debated about whether to include this or the longer, stranger Lynch film Inland Empire. Neither are films you can shake out of your mind but ultimately the nod goes to Mulholland Drive. It’s hard to say how the original plan for a TV show would have gone. Instead Lynch salvaged the stillborn pilot to create an enduring work of art. A lot of movies are weird for the sake of being weird while having nothing of substance underneath (take the paper-thin Donnie Darko, maybe the most overrated movie of the decade) but here Lynch delivers something worth digging into and exploring. In the end it’s really quite a simple story, but half the fun is piecing it all together. The other half is watching it - the scene of the opera singer dropping dead during Roy Orbison’s song Crying, thus revealing everything as an illusion, is a contender for greatest scene of the decade.\n\n\n\\item Lost in Translation (Sofia Coppola, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nBill Murray and Scarlett Johansson star in a surprisingly non-creepy sort of romance story about two tourists in Japan trying to figure it all out.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThe oughts had a bit of an obsession with movies about people ‘finding’ themselves. Lost in Translation was the best of the bunch and set the bar for the Junos, Little Miss Sunshines and Garden States that followed. People tend to gush over, say, holocaust movies because of their heavy subject regardless of whether they’re well made. Yet here is a movie about two upper-class people fighting ennui and through some truly graceful filmmaking we genuinely relate to and care for them. In this case less is more: Long stretches of no dialogue? Instead take in the excellent soundtrack by Air. Having no plot to speak of? Yeah, well neither does real life. Coppola mixes just the right blend of wistfulness and humour so that by the ending fade out you feel truly satisfied.\n\n\n\\item Battle Royale (Kinji Fukasaku, 2000)\n\nWhat is it?\nIn a futuristic dystopian Japan, a class of grade nine students is kidnapped, taken to an island, given weapons and told they must fight to the death until only one is left alive.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nUh, did you see the premise? Usually something that sounds that batshit awesome turns out to be a heap of disappointment. Not this time. This is one movie that knows how to follow through. I sill rank the first time I saw Battle Royale in high school as one of the most mind-blowing cinema experiences of my life.\n\n\n\\item Before Sunset (Richard Linklater, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nJulie Delpy and Ethan Hawke reunite 10 years after a one-night romantic tryst.\n\nWhy is it great?\n1995’s Before Sunrise was a charming film about two young people meeting randomly for one passionate night in Europe. Making a follow-up to its excellent ending – will they or won’t they fulfill their promise to meet one year later? – seemed like a terrible idea. Instead, this sequel bests its predecessor in every way. Delpy and Hawke still have some of the best on-screen chemistry ever seen, but 10 years later life has gotten complicated and their discussions have more weight. Instead of a young fairytale romance, here are two adults trying to recreate a fairytale romance. The beauty is in watching them pull it off. Linklater’s direction couldn’t be better – for a film that is basically one long string of dialogue it’s the sparse use of silence that has the most impact.\n\n\n\\item Memento (Christopher Nolan, 2000)\n\nWhat is it?\nThe story of a man with no short-term memory hunting his wife’s killer. Oh, and the movie runs backwards.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nI feel a pretty deep connection to this movie. At the time of its release it was my favourite film and in many ways it sparked my love of movies. It’s not the only film to do the backwards chronology thing (2002’s Irreversible, which I painfully couldn’t fit on this list, is a notable example) but it uses it brilliantly. What could have been a gimmick becomes an incredibly fresh way to tell a dark, unforgettable story that is still captivating today. This is raw movie-making gold.\n\n\n\\item Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2 (Quentin Tarantino, 2003/2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nTarantino, master of the literal title, delivers a loving homage to samurai movies.\n\nWhy is it great?\nFirst of all, it''s one big story so I''m throwing the two movies together. What''s striking about Kill Bill is that so much of it is made up of recycled parts. By assembling a mountain of shots and moments and molding them into one Power Rangersesque super movie, Tarantino has surpassed his source material. Only in Pulp Fiction has Tarantino brought style and substance together in such a dynamite package. Plus it rejuvanated David Carradine''s career, so huge bonus points.\n\n\n\\item Oldboy (Chan-wook Park, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nDuring a night of heavy drinking a man is mysteriously abducted, kept captive in a hotel-style room for 15 years without explanation and then released. He immediately goes on a quest for answers - and revenge.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThank god rumours of an American remake seem to have fizzled out. There is just no way to improve upon this breathtaking film. Like Battle Royale, Oldboy takes a wicked premise and doesn''t just live up to it but exceeds it. Chan-wook Park challenges you to keep up to his winding story that ventures miles beyond what mainstream western movies would dare to touch. This is revenge cinema at its finest. It''s so good that its also having one of the best fight scenes of the decade doesn''t even seem fair.\n\n\n\\item Shaun of the Dead (Edgar Wright, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nA comedy? A horror movie? A zom-com? Who knows?\n\nWhy is it great?\nSure, it’s quick and funny enough to be on the list for yuks alone. But beyond that, Shaun is actually quite groundbreaking. How many movies, if any, have managed to so finely walk a line between two disparate genres? A hilarious toss up of zombie films while at the same time being a zombie film, Shaun of the Dead is the ultimate case of having your brains and eating them too.\n\n\n\\item No Country for Old Men (The Coen brothers, 2007)\n\nWhat is it?\nThe best thriller of the decade.\n\nWhy is it great?\nSuck it, Stephen Spielberg. Joel and Ethan Coen show that they are the masters of cat-and-mouse thrill ride filmmaking. Everyone brings their A game to this one. You can''t ask for better technical camerawork and editing. Its pacing is unconventional but works to a tee. The cast is excellent but the show is stolen by Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh. With the Joker, Chigurh is one two characters that elevated villainhood to new hights. And of course the star behind the screen is Cormac McCArthy, whose faithfully adapted novel this all stems from.\n\n\n\\item Zodiac (David Fincher, 2007)\n\nWhat is it?\nA genre-breaking film about the real life hunt to track down the Zodiac Killer.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nCould this be the best serial killer movie ever? I guess it’s not a fair question. While most focus on the mind of the killer (take Fincher’s own Se7en), this movie is about the people hunting him. More truly, it’s about obsession. Fincher puts on an absolute clinic of filmmaking. He juggles an incredible cast of characters (especially Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr.) and a complex, weaving plot that spans decades of dead ends and false starts, yet the movie never stops being gripping. It’s a story that shouldn’t work but Fincher inverts the focus and makes this all about that wing of human nature that refuses – or isn’t able – to let things go. People who derided this film as ''slow'' need to go back and see all that''s going as they''re missing exquisite filmmaking.\n\n\n\\item The Barbarian Invasions (Denys Arcand, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nA Quebecois professor is diagnosed with cancer and admitted to hospital. As the end of his life nears, his family and friends gather together to see him off.\n\nWhy is it great?\nAdmittedly, the premise makes this movie sound entirely depressing. It’s not. It’s filled with dark humour, off-colour jokes, womanizing and drug use. This makes the moments of poignancy and insight that much more powerful. Clever, debauched and somehow comforting, this is a personal fable about something we all try to do eventually - come to terms with death. This is also my favourite Canadian film, period.\n\\end{enumerate}', 14552);

(15, 1, '2011-02-12 20:18:56', 'What is it?\nDaniel Day-Lewis drinks other people’s milkshakes.\n\nWhy is it great?\nTo be honest, I’ve never found the character study of Daniel Plainview fully satisfying. We learn so much about how he is but virtually nothing about why. From his initial hatred of humanity to his final descent into loner hell, we’re never given an understanding as to what’s behind it all, which I think limits the character’s impact. Still, when the movie works it really works. When you’ve got one of the best directors alive working with one of the best actors alive in an early American oil epic it’s almost hard for it not to be great. Anderson’s beautiful, patient shots and the brilliant Plainview vs. Eli Sunday scenes are going to be just as riveting 50 years from now as they are today.\n\n\\includegraphics{frise_14.jpg}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Super Troopers (Jay Chandrasekhar, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nA group of highway patrol officers get up to some shenanigans.\n\nWhy is it great?\nA lot of people seem to have Anchorman as one of their top movies, and for a while I was thinking of including it. Then my friend Alex shaved his beard into a moustache and I made a crack about moustache rides. Suddenly it hit me – Super Troopers is one of the best films of the decade. It has moments like its brilliant opening that can go toe-to-toe with Anchorman’s best scenes and it did a better job of not slipping into lazy, sit-comy writing. It’s smarter than Harold and Kumar, more consistent than Pineapple Express and more distinct than the pack of Judd Apatow flicks that filled the OOs. Quite simply, it’s the best stoner comedy of the decade.\n\n\n\\item Spirited Away (Hayao Miyazaki, 2001)\n\nWhat is it?\nA little girl stumbles into a ghost world after her parents are transformed into pigs. A modern-day Alice in Wonderland follows.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThis was an enviable decade to be a kid, as many children’s movies stopped relying on clichés and Phil Collins soundtracks and started treating their audiences with respect. But the one that impressed me the most wasn’t made by Pixar. Containing more visual ideas than 10 Disney movies combined along with a universal story about childhood, Spirited Away is the best animated film of the decade.\n\n\n\\item The Dark Knight (Christopher Nolan, 2008)\n\nWhat is it?\nNana nana nana nana nana nana nana nana… Batman.\n\nWhy is it great?\nI almost went with Christopher Nolan’s excellent rival magicians movie The Prestige instead, but ultimately I’ve got to hand it to The Dark Knight. Sure the whole x-ray vision stuff was goofy and there were some problems with the plot, but it deserves a spot for a few reasons.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item It marked the growing up of super hero movies. In his flick, Spiderman had to choose between saving Mary Jane or a trolley full of people. He pulled some web bullshit and voila, everyone’s fine. Batman was given the same choice and a main character died.\n\\item Hack movies like Babel get fawned over for insipid themes like "not communicating is bad." The Dark Knight deals with dark thematic issues most movies never touch, like the West’s responsibility for terrorism, deceiving the masses for their own good, love not saving anyone and the impossibility of living up to heroic expectations.\n\\item Incredibly memorable moments, like the bank heist opening.\n\\item Heath Ledger''s The Joker. Not just one of the two greatest villains of the decade, he''s one of the best all-time movie bad guys.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\item Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Michel Gondry, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nA love story told backwards as it’s forgotten.\n\nWhy is it great?\nBlah blah blah, Charlie Kaufman, blah blah, Michel Gondry, blah blah. By now everyone knows the praise for the script, visuals, and performances of this movie so I won’t rehash it here. Instead I’ll just say one thing I really respect about Eternal Sunshine is it resisted the urge to romanticize. Instead of waiting for the couple to figure out they’re obviously meant to be together, Eternal Sunshine gives us characters that probably aren’t right for each other and may well be doomed to repeat their mistakes. It’s this heavy dose of reality as much as the script and visuals that made this such a fresh viewing experience. And damn it, we’re all still rooting for Joel and Clementine.\n\n\n\\item 28 Days Later (Danny Boyle, 2002)\n\nWhat is it?\nA brilliantly stylized reinvention of the zombie genre from one of film''s most versatile directors.\n\nWhy is great?\nThis is the second most important zombie movie of all time (after Night of the Living Dead, obviously). Where Romero invented the genre as we know it, Boyle reinvented it for the 21st century. But there’s so much more than just the “fast zombies” that makes this movie great. Just watch the beginning and by the haunting scene of Cilian Murphy wandering around an abandoned London you know you’ve got a classic. And yes, 28 Days Later does count as a zombie movie.\n\n\n\\item Children of Men (Alfonso Cuaron, 2006)\n\nWhat is it?\nClive Own wanders the streets of a ragged, dying Britain. Children inexplicably stopped being born years ago, the youngest man in the world was just killed in a bar fight, xenophobia has manifested into a militaristic dictatorship and – oh shit, is that chick pregnant?\n\nWhy s it on the list?\nMan, these ten years were pretty thin on great sci fi movies.

In this case less is more: Long stretches of no dialogue? Instead take in the excellent soundtrack by Air. Having no plot to speak of? Yeah, well neither does real life. Coppola mixes just the right blend of wistfulness and humour so that by the ending fade out you feel truly satisfied.\n\n\n\\item Battle Royale (Kinji Fukasaku, 2000)\n\nWhat is it?\nIn a futuristic dystopian Japan, a class of grade nine students is kidnapped, taken to an island, given weapons and told they must fight to the death until only one is left alive.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nUh, did you see the premise? Usually something that sounds that batshit awesome turns out to be a heap of disappointment. Not this time. This is one movie that knows how to follow through. I sill rank the first time I saw Battle Royale in high school as one of the most mind-blowing cinema experiences of my life.\n\n\n\\item Before Sunset (Richard Linklater, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nJulie Delpy and Ethan Hawke reunite 10 years after a one-night romantic tryst.\n\nWhy is it great?\n1995’s Before Sunrise was a charming film about two young people meeting randomly for one passionate night in Europe. Making a follow-up to its excellent ending – will they or won’t they fulfill their promise to meet one year later? – seemed like a terrible idea. Instead, this sequel bests its predecessor in every way. Delpy and Hawke still have some of the best on-screen chemistry ever seen, but 10 years later life has gotten complicated and their discussions have more weight. Instead of a young fairytale romance, here are two adults trying to recreate a fairytale romance. The beauty is in watching them pull it off. Linklater’s direction couldn’t be better – for a film that is basically one long string of dialogue it’s the sparse use of silence that has the most impact.\n\n\n\\item Memento (Christopher Nolan, 2000)\n\nWhat is it?\nThe story of a man with no short-term memory hunting his wife’s killer. Oh, and the movie runs backwards.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nI feel a pretty deep connection to this movie. At the time of its release it was my favourite film and in many ways it sparked my love of movies. It’s not the only film to do the backwards chronology thing (2002’s Irreversible, which I painfully couldn’t fit on this list, is a notable example) but it uses it brilliantly. What could have been a gimmick becomes an incredibly fresh way to tell a dark, unforgettable story that is still captivating today. This is raw movie-making gold.\n\n\n\\item Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2 (Quentin Tarantino, 2003/2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nTarantino, master of the literal title, delivers a loving homage to samurai movies.\n\nWhy is it great?\nFirst of all, it''s one big story so I''m throwing the two movies together. What''s striking about Kill Bill is that so much of it is made up of recycled parts. By assembling a mountain of shots and moments and molding them into one Power Rangersesque super movie, Tarantino has surpassed his source material. Only in Pulp Fiction has Tarantino brought style and substance together in such a dynamite package. Plus it rejuvanated David Carradine''s career, so huge bonus points.\n\n\n\\item Oldboy (Chan-wook Park, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nDuring a night of heavy drinking a man is mysteriously abducted, kept captive in a hotel-style room for 15 years without explanation and then released. He immediately goes on a quest for answers - and revenge.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThank god rumours of an American remake seem to have fizzled out. There is just no way to improve upon this breathtaking film. Like Battle Royale, Oldboy takes a wicked premise and doesn''t just live up to it but exceeds it. Chan-wook Park challenges you to keep up to his winding story that ventures miles beyond what mainstream western movies would dare to touch. This is revenge cinema at its finest. It''s so good that its also having one of the best fight scenes of the decade doesn''t even seem fair.\n\n\n\\item Shaun of the Dead (Edgar Wright, 2004)\n\nWhat is it?\nA comedy? A horror movie? A zom-com? Who knows?\n\nWhy is it great?\nSure, it’s quick and funny enough to be on the list for yuks alone. But beyond that, Shaun is actually quite groundbreaking. How many movies, if any, have managed to so finely walk a line between two disparate genres? A hilarious toss up of zombie films while at the same time being a zombie film, Shaun of the Dead is the ultimate case of having your brains and eating them too.\n\n\n\\item No Country for Old Men (The Coen brothers, 2007)\n\nWhat is it?\nThe best thriller of the decade.\n\nWhy is it great?\nSuck it, Stephen Spielberg. Joel and Ethan Coen show that they are the masters of cat-and-mouse thrill ride filmmaking. Everyone brings their A game to this one. You can''t ask for better technical camerawork and editing. Its pacing is unconventional but works to a tee. The cast is excellent but the show is stolen by Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh. With the Joker, Chigurh is one two characters that elevated villainhood to new hights. And of course the star behind the screen is Cormac McCArthy, whose faithfully adapted novel this all stems from.\n\n\n\\item Zodiac (David Fincher, 2007)\n\nWhat is it?\nA genre-breaking film about the real life hunt to track down the Zodiac Killer.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\nCould this be the best serial killer movie ever? I guess it’s not a fair question. While most focus on the mind of the killer (take Fincher’s own Se7en), this movie is about the people hunting him. More truly, it’s about obsession. Fincher puts on an absolute clinic of filmmaking. He juggles an incredible cast of characters (especially Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr.) and a complex, weaving plot that spans decades of dead ends and false starts, yet the movie never stops being gripping. It’s a story that shouldn’t work but Fincher inverts the focus and makes this all about that wing of human nature that refuses – or isn’t able – to let things go. People who derided this film as ''slow'' need to go back and see all that''s going as they''re missing exquisite filmmaking.\n\n\n\\item The Barbarian Invasions (Denys Arcand, 2003)\n\nWhat is it?\nA Quebecois professor is diagnosed with cancer and admitted to hospital. As the end of his life nears, his family and friends gather together to see him off.\n\nWhy is it great?\nAdmittedly, the premise makes this movie sound entirely depressing. It’s not. It’s filled with dark humour, off-colour jokes, womanizing and drug use. This makes the moments of poignancy and insight that much more powerful. Clever, debauched and somehow comforting, this is a personal fable about something we all try to do eventually - come to terms with death. This is also my favourite Canadian film, period.\n\\end{enumerate}', 14544),
(17, 1, '2011-02-12 20:20:17', 'What is it?\nDaniel Day-Lewis drinks other people’s milkshakes.\n\nWhy is it great?\nTo be honest, I’ve never found the character study of Daniel Plainview fully satisfying. We learn so much about how he is but virtually nothing about why. From his initial hatred of humanity to his final descent into loner hell, we’re never given an understanding as to what’s behind it all, which I think limits the character’s impact. Still, when the movie works it really works. When you’ve got one of the best directors alive working with one of the best actors alive in an early American oil epic it’s almost hard for it not to be great. Anderson’s beautiful, patient shots and the brilliant Plainview vs. Eli Sunday scenes are going to be just as riveting 50 years from now as they are today.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\textbf{Super Troopers (Jay Chandrasekhar, 2001)}\n\nWhat is it?\nA group of highway patrol officers get up to some shenanigans.\n\nWhy is it great?\nA lot of people seem to have Anchorman as one of their top movies, and for a while I was thinking of including it. Then my friend Alex shaved his beard into a moustache and I made a crack about moustache rides. Suddenly it hit me – Super Troopers is one of the best films of the decade. It has moments like its brilliant opening that can go toe-to-toe with Anchorman’s best scenes and it did a better job of not slipping into lazy, sit-comy writing. It’s smarter than Harold and Kumar, more consistent than Pineapple Express and more distinct than the pack of Judd Apatow flicks that filled the OOs. Quite simply, it’s the best stoner comedy of the decade.\n\n\n\\item \\textbf{Spirited Away (Hayao Miyazaki, 2001)}\n\nWhat is it?\nA little girl stumbles into a ghost world after her parents are transformed into pigs. A modern-day Alice in Wonderland follows.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThis was an enviable decade to be a kid, as many children’s movies stopped relying on clichés and Phil Collins soundtracks and started treating their audiences with respect. But the one that impressed me the most wasn’t made by Pixar. Containing more visual ideas than 10 Disney movies combined along with a universal story about childhood, Spirited Away is the best animated film of the decade.\n\n\n\\item \\textbf{The Dark Knight (Christopher Nolan, 2008)}\n\nWhat is it?\nNana nana nana nana nana nana nana nana… Batman.\n\nWhy is it great?\nI almost went with Christopher Nolan’s excellent rival magicians movie The Prestige instead, but ultimately I’ve got to hand it to The Dark Knight. Sure the whole x-ray vision stuff was goofy and there were some problems with the plot, but it deserves a spot for a few reasons.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\textbf{It marked the growing up of super hero movies. In his flick, Spiderman had to choose between saving Mary Jane or a trolley full of people. He pulled some web bullshit and voila, everyone’s fine. Batman was given the same choice and a main character died.}\n\\item \\textbf{Hack movies like Babel get fawned over for insipid themes like "not communicating is bad." The Dark Knight deals with dark thematic issues most movies never touch, like the West’s responsibility for terrorism, deceiving the masses for their own good, love not saving anyone and the impossibility of living up to heroic expectations.}\n\\item \\textbf{Incredibly memorable moments, like the bank heist opening.}\n\\item \\textbf{Heath Ledger''s The Joker. Not just one of the two greatest villains of the decade, he''s one of the best all-time movie bad guys.}\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Michel Gondry, 2004)}\n\nWhat is it?\nA love story told backwards as it’s forgotten.\n\nWhy is it great?\nBlah blah blah, Charlie Kaufman, blah blah, Michel Gondry, blah blah. By now everyone knows the praise for the script, visuals, and performances of this movie so I won’t rehash it here. Instead I’ll just say one thing I really respect about Eternal Sunshine is it resisted the urge to romanticize. Instead of waiting for the couple to figure out they’re obviously meant to be together, Eternal Sunshine gives us characters that probably aren’t right for each other and may well be doomed to repeat their mistakes. It’s this heavy dose of reality as much as the script and visuals that made this such a fresh viewing experience. And damn it, we’re all still rooting for Joel and Clementine.\n\n\n\\item \\textbf{28 Days Later (Danny Boyle, 2002)}\n\nWhat is it?\nA brilliantly stylized reinvention of the zombie genre from one of film''s most versatile directors.\n\nWhy is great?\nThis is the second most important zombie movie of all time (after Night of the Living Dead, obviously). Where Romero invented the genre as we know it, Boyle reinvented it for the 21st century. But there’s so much more than just the “fast zombies” that makes this movie great. Just watch the beginning and by the haunting scene of Cilian Murphy wandering around an abandoned London you know you’ve got a classic. And yes, 28 Days Later does count as a zombie movie.\n\n\n\\item \\textbf{Children of Men (Alfonso Cuaron, 2006)}\n\nWhat is it?\nClive Own wanders the streets of a ragged, dying Britain. Children inexplicably stopped being born years ago, the youngest man in the world was just killed in a bar fight, xenophobia has manifested into a militaristic dictatorship and – oh shit, is that chick pregnant?\n\nWhy s it on the list?\nMan, these ten years were pretty thin on great sci fi movies. The 90s finished off on a high with Dark City and The Matrix then this decade tries to carry the torch with god-awful Matrix sequels and Star Wars prequels. The much championed Minority Report and Stark Trek were too shiny and pretty to be considered classics in my mind. Great sci fi should have some grit. Luckily we got quality mind-benders (Primer), space westerns (Serenity) and of course Children of Men, a story that encapsulates despair as well as any I’ve seen. Intriguing plot and strong acting aside, it’s the incredible cinematography that elevates this film to greatness. The stunning, single-shot car heist and city under siege scenes rank among the best of this generation.\n\n(Note: I’d probably have included Serenity on this list of not for that in my mind it’s inherently linked into the TV show Firefly.)\n\n\n\\item \\textbf{Mulholland Drive (David Lynch, 2001)}\n\nWhat is it?\nGood question.\n\nWhy is it great?\nI debated about whether to include this or the longer, stranger Lynch film Inland Empire. Neither are films you can shake out of your mind but ultimately the nod goes to Mulholland Drive. It’s hard to say how the original plan for a TV show would have gone. Instead Lynch salvaged the stillborn pilot to create an enduring work of art. A lot of movies are weird for the sake of being weird while having nothing of substance underneath (take the paper-thin Donnie Darko, maybe the most overrated movie of the decade) but here Lynch delivers something worth digging into and exploring. In the end it’s really quite a simple story, but half the fun is piecing it all together. The other half is watching it - the scene of the opera singer dropping dead during Roy Orbison’s song Crying, thus revealing everything as an illusion, is a contender for greatest scene of the decade.\n\n\n\\item \\textbf{Lost in Translation (Sofia Coppola, 2003)}\n\nWhat is it?\nBill Murray and Scarlett Johansson star in a surprisingly non-creepy sort of romance story about two tourists in Japan trying to figure it all out.\n\nWhy is it great?\nThe oughts had a bit of an obsession with movies about people ‘finding’ themselves. Lost in Translation was the best of the bunch and set the bar for the Junos, Little Miss Sunshines and Garden States that followed. People tend to gush over, say, holocaust movies because of their heavy subject regardless of whether they’re well made. Yet here is a movie about two upper-class people fighting ennui and through some truly graceful filmmaking we genuinely relate to and care for them. In this case less is more: Long stretches of no dialogue? Instead take in the excellent soundtrack by Air. Having no plot to speak of? Yeah, well neither does real life.
